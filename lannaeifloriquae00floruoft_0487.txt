IX. CONON

1. Conon the Athenian began his public career at
the time of the Peloponnesian war, and in that war
he rendered important service3 for he commanded
the land forces with the rank of general, and as
admira] of the fleet he did great deeds on the sea.
In recognition of this an unusual honour was con-
ferred upon him3 he was given sole charge of all
the islands, and while holding that commission 2 he
took Pherae, a colony 3 of the Lacedaemonians. He
was also commander-in-chief at the close of the
Peloponnesian war, when the Athenian forces were
defeated by Lysander at Aegospotamoi3 but he was
absent at the time, and in consequence the affair
was badly managed3 for he was skilled in military
science and a careful commander. Hence no one
who lived in those times doubted that, if he had
been present, the Athenians would not have suffered
that disaster.

2. But when the calamity came and he heard that
his native city was in a state of siege, he looked
about for a place, not where he could himself live in

Conon never had such a commission. He took Pherae in
393 B.c., when he was in the service of the Persian king3
