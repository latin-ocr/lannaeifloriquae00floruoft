XI. IPHICRATES

l. Iphicrates, the Athenian, gained renown by
1115 great deeds, but still more by his knowledge
of the art of war3 for not only was he a leader
comparable with the greatest of his 01111 time,
but not even among the men of earlier days 1135

soldiers might move and charge more easily when
less burdened. He doubled the length of the spear
and increased that of the swords3 he changed the
character of their breastplates, giving them linen
ones in place of bronze cuirasses or chain armour.
