INTRODUOTION

De Viris Illustn‘bus, in at least sixteen books.¹
Nepos arranged his biographies in groups of two
books each. The first book of every group
included the distinguished men of foreign nations,
for the most part Greeks; the second, those of
Rome. From references of Nepos himself and
others2 the categories of generals, historians,
kings and poets have been determined. What
the other four were is uncertain; philosophers,
orators, statesmen and grammarians have been
suggested. The reference of Gellius 3 to Book xii
with reference to a Roman historian is variously
explained, some assuming an error in the text
of Gellius; others, that an introductory book
of a general character preceded and introduced
the pairs of lives.

Of this work we have the entire book De Excel-
lentibus Ducibus Exterarum Gentium, and two lives
from the book De Historieis Latinis, besides a few
fragments. The former was for a long time believed

Q) to be the work of Aemilius Probus, a grammarian of
’ the time of Theodosius II (A D. 408-4050) on account
of an epigram of his which appears in some of the
manuscripts after the Life of Hannibal.

It reads as follows:

 

Vade, liber, nostri fato meliore mement03
Cum leget haec dominus, te sciat esse meum.

Nec metuas fulvo strictos diademate crines,
Ridentes blandum vel pietate oculos.
