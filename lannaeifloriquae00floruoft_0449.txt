might have something to give at once, for fear that
by delay he might seem to refuse. Osten, when he
chanced to have met a man who was ill-treated by
fortune and poorly clad, he gave him his cloak.
Every day he had such an abundant dinner pre-
pared that he could entertain all whom he saw in
the market-place who had not been invited by
others 13 and this he never failed to do each day.
No one asked in vain for his protection, no one for
his services, no one for his financial aid; he enriched
many, and buried at his own expense a great number
who had died so poor that they had left nothing to
pay for their funerals. Such being his conduct, it
is not surprising that his life was free from trouble
and his death deeply regretted.

VI. LYSANDER

1. Lysander the Lacedaemonian left a great
reputation, gained rather by good fortune than by
merit. There is no doubt, indeed, that he put an
end to the power of the Athenians, who had been

valour of his army, but to the lack of discipline of
his opponents, who did not obey their generals,
but, leaving their ships and seattering about the
country, fell into the power of the enemy.3 As
a result, the Athenians surrendered to the Lace-

daemonians.
