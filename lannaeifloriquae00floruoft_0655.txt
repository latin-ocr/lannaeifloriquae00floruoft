hundred miles. In the course of that retreat the
Numidians who had left the field with him laid a
trap for him, but he not only eluded them, but even
crushed the plotters. At Hadrumetum he rallied
the survivors of the retreat and by means of new levies
mustered a large number of soldiers within a few
da s.

tions, the Carthaginians made peace with the Romans.
Hannibal, however, continued after that to command
the army and carried on war in Africa until the consul-
ship of Publius Sulpicius and Gaius Aurelius. For
in the time of those magistrates Carthaginian envoys
came to Rome, to return thanks to the Roman senate
and people for having made peace with them 3 and
as a mark of gratitude they presented them with a
golden crown, at the same time asking that their
hostages might live at Fregellae and that their
prisoners should be returned. To them, in accord-
ance with a decree of the senate, the following answer
was made: that their gift was received with thanks;
that the hostages should live where they had re-
quested3 that they would not return the prisonem,
because Hannibal, who had caused the war and was
bitterly hostile to the Roman nation, still held com-
mand in their army, as well as his brother Mago.
Upon receiving that reply the Carthaginians recalled
Hannibal and Mago to Carthage. On his return
Hannibal was made a king,1 after he had been
general for twenty-one years. For, as is true of
the consuls at Rome, so at Carthage two kings were
elected annually for a term of one year.
