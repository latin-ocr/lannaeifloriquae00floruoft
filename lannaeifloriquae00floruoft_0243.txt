the treasury, the very life-blood of the State; and
how could the common people be restored to the
land without dispossessing those who were in occu-

people and held estates bequeathed to them by their
forefathers under the quasi-legal title of prescriptive
right?

14. Tm: first flame of contentiori was kindled by
' Tiberius Gracchus, whose descent, personal attrac-
tions and eloquence made him undoubtedly the
leading man of his time. Either because he was
afraid of being involved in Mancinus’ surrender1 (for
he had been a surety for the performance of the
treaty) and therefore joined the popular party, or
because he acted from motives of justice and right,
pitying the commons who were deprived of their
own lands [so that a people who had been victorious
over the nations and possessed the whole world
might not be exiled from their own hearths and
homes],2 whatever his motives, he ventured to take
a very serious step. When the day for bringing
forward the bill was at hand, he ascended the rostra
surrounded by a large following; and the nobility
were all there to resist him with their supporters, and
the tribunes 3 were on their side. But when Gracchus
saw that Gaius‘¹ Octavius was going to veto his
proposals, he laid hands upon him, contrary to the
rights of the tribunicial college and the privileges of

⁸ zze. the other tribunes of the people.
