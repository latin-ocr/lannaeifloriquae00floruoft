INTRODUCTION

is obviously not at home in them. His principal
rhetorical devices are rhythmical clausulae, allitera-
tion and antithesis. The last-named figure is used to
such excess that his sentences are frequently over-
loaded at the beginning, and end weakly. Although
he was a contemporary of Caesar and Cicero, his
Latinity belongs with that of Varro and the writers
of the supplements to Caesar's Cz'vz'l lVar. He has
some archaisms, numerous colloquial words and
expressions, and some words that are common to him
and writers of a later date. He has little variety in
his diction3 in particular he uses nam and enim to an
extent which taxes the ingenuity of a translator.
He is also fond of the pronoun hic, probably owing to
the influence of the Alexandrine biographers.1

Although Nepos makes direct mention of Thucy-
dides, Xenophon's Agesilaus, Plato's Symposium,
Theopompus, Dinon, Timaeus, Silenus, Sosylus,
Polybius, Sulpicius Blitho, Atticus and the writings
of Hannibal, it is obvious that he rarely‚ if ever,
made first-hand use of those authorities. The
material which he needed for his Greek subj ects was
available in the biographical literature of that
country,2 such as the works of Antigonus of Carystus,
Hermippus and Satyrus. In the biographies of
Romans, which are lost except for the Cato and the
Atticus, he may have depended to a greater extent
on historical sources, although he had predecessors
in Varro and Santra.
