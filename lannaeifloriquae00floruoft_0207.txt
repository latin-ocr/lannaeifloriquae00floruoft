BOOK Ι. Χι.

and that one king after another was rising, con-
sidered that he ought not to delay, and before the
nations could consolidate their strength, built a
bridge of boats over the Euphrates, and was the
first to cross that river by this means, and coming up
with the king as he was fleeing through the middle
of Armenia, defeated him, with his usual good luck,
in a single battle. The engagement took place at
night, and the moon took sides in it3 for when the
goddess, as if fighting on Pompeius’ side, had placed
herself behind the enemy and facing the Romans,
the men of Pontus aimed at their own unusually long
shadows, thinking that they were the bodies of their
foeS. That night saw the final defeat of Mithridates ;
for he never again effected anything, although, like
a snake, which, though its head is crushed, threatens
to the last with its tail, he tried every expedient.
For, after escaping from the enemy to the Colchians,
he formed a plan (though it remained only a plan) of
bridging the Bosporus and then crossing through
Thrace, Macedonia and Greece and making a sudden
inroad in Italy; but, baulked by the desertion of
his subjects and the treachery of his son Pharnaces,
he ended by the sword a life which he had in vain
tried to destroy with poison.

Meanwhile Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, pursuing
the remnants of rebellious Asia, was hastening
through nations and lands lying far apart. Follow-
ing the Armenians eastward he captured Artaxata,
the very capital of that race, and bade Tigranes,
who implored his pardon, retain his kingdom. To
the North, following the route to Scythia by the .
stars, as sailors steer at sea, he defeated the Colchians,
pardoned the Iberians, and spared the Albanians.
