XXV. ATTICUS, 1x. 7—x. 5

criticism of him arose from some of the aristocrats‚
because in their opinion he was not sufficiently hostile
to bad citizens.1 But Atticus, being a man of
independent judgment, had an eye rather to what it
was right for him to do than to what others were
likely to commend.

10. There came a sudden change of fortune.
Antony returned to Italy, and there was no one but
thought that Atticus was in extreme danger because
of his intimacy with Cicero and Brutus. T herefore,

from public life, fearing ’ proscription, and was in
- hiding at the house of Publius Volumnius, to whom,
as Ι have stated, he had shortly before rendered aid—-
such were the changes of fortune in those times that
now these, now those, were at the summit of power
or the extremity of danger-mand he had with him
Quintus Gellius Canus, a man of his own age and

of Atticus' good-heartedness, that he lived in such
harmony with this man, whom he had known as a boy
in school, that their friendship increased constantly

Atticus was, he wrote to him with his own hand,
telling him not to be afraid but to come to him at
once3 that he had erased his name, and for his sake
that of Canus, from the list of the proscribed. And
that no danger might befall him—for this happened
