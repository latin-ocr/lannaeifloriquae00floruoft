precious stones and pearls, regarded their long
Journey, in the accomplishment of which they had
spent four years, as the greatest tribute which they
rendered; and indeed their complexion proved that
they came from beneath another sky. The Parthians
too, as though they repented of their victory, volun-
tarily returned the standards which they had won
at the time of Crassus’ defeat. Thus everywhere
throughout the inhabited world there was firmly-
established and uninterrupted peace or truce, and
Caesar Augustus ventured at last, in the seven
hundredth year since the foundation of the city,1 to
close the double doors of the temple of J anus, which
had previously been shut on two occasions only, in
the reign of Numa and after the first defeat of
Carthage. Next, devoting himself to securing tran-
quillity, by many strict and severe enactments he
restrained an age which was prone to every vice
and readily led into luxury. For all these great
achievements he was named Perpetua] Imperator
and F ather of his Country. It was also discussed in
the senate whether he should not be called Romulus,
because he had established the empire; but the
name of Augustus was deemed more holy and
venerable, in order that, while he still dwelt upon
earth, he might be given a name and title which
raised him to the rank of a deity.
