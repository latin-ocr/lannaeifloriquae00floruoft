Tm: Lm: ΛΝΒ Wonsss OF CORNELIUS Nspos

CORNELIUS NEPOS (his praenomen is unknown) was
born in Cisalpine Gaul, the native land of Catullus,
Vergil Livy and the Plinys. The elder Pliny speaks
of him as Padi accola} and since we know that he was
a native of that part of Cisalpine Gaul which took its
name from the Insubres,2 it has been conjectured
that his birthplace was Ticinum, the modern Pavia.

The dates of his birth and death are not known
with certainty. He appears to have lived from
about 99 to about 24 13.c.; for we know that he sur-
vived Atticus, who died in 32 B.c., and that he lived
to an advanced age, The elder Pliny twice refers 3
to ‘⁶ Cornelius Nepos, qui divi Augusti principatu
obiit.”

Nepos took up his residence in Rome early and
spent the greater part of his life there. He seems to
have had an independent fortune and to have devoted
his entire attention to literary work. He apparently
took no part in political life ; at least, we know from
one of Pliny's letters that he was not of senatorial
rank.⁴ He exchanged letters with Cicero 5 and he
