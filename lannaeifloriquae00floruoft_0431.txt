ΙΙΙ. ARISTIDES, 11. 2—111. 3

military career except the memory of that com-
mand‚1 there are many instances of his justice,
equity and integrity3 in particular, that it was due
to his equity, when he was on the fleet of the Greek
allies in company with Pausanias, the general w ho
had routed Mardonius, that the supremacy of the
sea passed from the Lacedaemonians to the Athen-
ians. Until then, indeed, the Lacedaemonians had
held the lead on land and sea, but at that time the
arrogance of Pausanias and the justice of Aristides
led almost all the Greek cities to seek alliance with
the Athenians and choose them as their leaders
against the barbarians.

3. In order to repel the Persians more easily, if
by any chance they should attempt to renew the
war, Aristides was appointed to determine how
much money each state should contribute for the
purpose of building fleets and raising armies, and in
accordance with his decision four hundred and sixty
talents were deposited each year at Delos. That
place was selected as the treasury of the league, but
later2 all that money was transported to Athens.
There is no more certain proof of Aristides' in-
tegrity than the fact that, although he was entrusted
with the management of such important affairs, he
left so little money at his death, that there was
hardly enough to pay his funeral expenses. The
result was that his daughters were supported by
the state and, when they married, were provided
with dowries from the public treasury. Aristides
died about four years after Themistocles had been 4681302
banished from Athens.

² In the time of Periclem quae omnis pecunia means the
contributione as a whole, except what had been expended.
