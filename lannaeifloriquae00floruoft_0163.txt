BOOK 1. xxxix.

This city, by an act unworthy of the Romans, was
overwhelmed before it could be accounted in the
number of their declared enemies. The cause of
the war was the action of Critolaus,1 who used
against the Romans the liberty which they them-
selves had granted, and insulted the Roman am-
bassadors, certainly by his words and perhaps also
by persona] violence. The task of vengeance was
therefore entrusted to Metellus, who just at the
time was settling matters in Macedonia. Thus the
Achaean war began. F irst of all the consul Metellus ²
defeated the forces of Critolaus all along the Alpheus
in the wide plains of Elis. The war was thus finished
by a single battle, and a siege already threatened the
city itself; but—so fate decreed——though Metellus
had fought the battle, Mummius interposed to reap
the fruits of the victory. He completely routed the
army of the other general, Diaeus, in the very neck
of the Isthmus and dyed the twin harbours with
blood. The city, deserted by its inhabitants, was
first plundered and then destroyed at a signal given
by trumpets. What a vast quantity of statues,
garments and pictures was carried off, burnt, and
thrown away ! How great was the wealth which was
plundered or burnt may be judged from the fact
that we are told that all the Corinthian bronze-
work, which enjoys so high a repute throughout the
world, was a survival from the conflagration. For
the damage inflicted on this rich city in itself caused
a higher value to be placed upon Corinthian bronze,
because, by the melting together of count-less statues
and images by the flames, brass, gold and silver ore
were fused into one common mass.
