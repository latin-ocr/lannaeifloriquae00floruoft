settling down at Tarraco in Spain and adopting the
profession of letters. He must subsequently have
migrated to in Rome in the principate of Hadrian.

The Epilome itself contains no intel-nal evidence
about the life of its author except as to the date at
which he composed the work. He states (Ι. Introd.,
8) that a period of not much less than two hundred
years had elapsed since Caesar Augustus (a Caesare
Augusto in saeculum nostrum haud multo minus anni
ducenti). It is difficult to decide how to interpret
the words α Caesare Augusto. It would perhaps be
most natural to take 27 B.c., the date of the founda-
tion of the Principate, as the floruit of Augustus, in
which case the composition of the Epitome would
fall in the Principate of Marcus Aurelius. If, on
the other hand, we may take the birth of Augustus
in 63 13.c. as the beginning of the period of 'two
hundred years, the date of the composition will fall
in the second half of the Principate of Hadrian, a
date which is consistent with the identification of
the author as the literary friend of Hadrian.

Livy is by no means the only source, and Florus
frequently makes statements which are at variance

with those of Livy. The works of Sallust and
