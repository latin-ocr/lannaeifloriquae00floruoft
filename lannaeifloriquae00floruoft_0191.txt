BOOK Ι. xxxvm.

fui-y and rage, which in barbarians takes the place
of courage, spent itself. The barbarians, therefore,
made off, jeering at our men and—such was their
confidence that they would capture Rome—advising
them to give them any messages which they had for
their wives. With a speed which amply fulfilled
their threats, they bore down towards the Alps,
which form the barriers of Italy, in three detach-
mentS. Marius with wonderful celerity immediately,
by taking shorter routeS‚ outstripped the enemy,
and coming upon the Teutones first at the very
foot of the Alps, what a defeat he inflicted upon
them, ye heavenly powers, at the place called
Aquae Sextiae! The enemy held the valley and
the river flowing through it, while our men had no
water-supply. It is uncertain whether the general
acted designedly or whether he converted a mistake
into a stratagem; at any rate the valour of the
Romans under the constraint of necessity gave them
victory. For when the men demanded water,
Marius replied, “ If you are men, there it is yonder
for you.’' With such ardour, then, did they fight
and such was the slaughter of the enemy that the
victorious Romans drank quite as much barbarian
gore as water from the blood-stained stream. Their
king, Teutobodus himself, who had been accustomed
to vault over four or even six horses, could scarcely
find one to mount when he fied, and having been
captured in a neighbouring forest was a striking
figure in the triumphal procession3 for, being a
man of extraordinary stature, he towered above the
trophies of his defeat.

The Teutones having been thus absolutely de-
stroyed, attention was next directed to the Cimbri.
