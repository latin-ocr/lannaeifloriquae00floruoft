XXIII. HANNIBAL, 11. 6-111. 4

you have any kindly intentions with regard to the
Roman people, you will be wise to hide them from
me; but when you prepare war, you will go counter
to your own interests if you do not make me the
leader in that enterprise.'’ ’

3. Accordingly, at the age which I have named,
Hannibal went with his father to Spain, and after
Hamilcar died and Hasdrubal succeeded to the
chief command, he was given “charge of all the
cavalry. When Hasdrubal died in his turn, the
army chose Hannibal as its commander, and on their
action being reported at Carthage, it was officially 221 ac.
confirmed. So it was that when he was less than
twenty-five years old,1 Hannibal became commander-
in-chief ; and within the next three years he subdued
all the peoples of Spain by force of arms, stormed
Saguntum, a town allied with Rome, and mustered 219 ac
three great armies. Of these armies he sent one
to Africa, left the second with his brother Hasdrubal
in Spain, and led the third with him into Italy. He
crossed the range of the Pyrenees. VVherever he
marched, he warred with all the natives, and he was
everywhere victorious.

NVhen he carne to the Alps separating Italy from
Gaul, which no one before him had ever crossed with
an army except the Grecian Hercules—because
of which that place is called the Grecian Pass ²—
he cut to pieces the Alpine tribes that tried to keep
him from crossing, opened up the region, built roads,
and made it possible for an elephant with its equip-
ment to go over places along which before that a
single unarmed man could barely creep. By this
route he led his forces across the Alps and came
into Italy.
