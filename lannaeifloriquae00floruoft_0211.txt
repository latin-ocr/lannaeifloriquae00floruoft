were preoccupied in various parts of the world, the
Cilicians had invaded the seas, and, making inter-

Servilius was sent against them,and, although with his
heavy and well-equipped ships of war he defeated their
light and elusive brigantines, he won a by no means

driven them off the seas, he overthrew their strongest
cities, full of spoil collected over a long period, Phaselis,
Olympus and the city of the Isauri, the verystronghold
of Cilicia, from which, conscious of the greatness of
his achievement, he assumed the title of Isauricus.

the earth, as soon as ever the enemy had gone away,
