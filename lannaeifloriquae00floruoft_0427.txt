II. THEMISTOCLES, x. 1—5
10. The king, admiring his high spirit, and eager

'co uin the friendship of such a man, granted his
request. Themistocles devoted all that time to
the literature and language of the Persians, in
which he became so well versed that he is said to
have spoken in much better style before the king
than those could who were natives of Persia.1
Themistocles made many promises to the king, of
which the most welcome was, that if Artaxerxes
would consent to follow his advice, the king's arms
would subjugate Greece. Then‚ after receiving
many presents from the monarch, he returned to
Asia 2 and took up his residence at Magnesia3 for
the king had given him that city, with the remark
that it would furnish him with bread (the annual
revenue of the district was five hundred talents),
also LampsacUS, to supply him with wine, and
Myus, to furnish the rest of his fare.3

Two memorials of this man have endured to our
own day: his tomb near the town in which he was
buried,4 and his statue in the Forum at Magnesia.
Of his death many different accounts are given by
numerous writers, but once more I prefer to accept
the testimony of Thucydides. That historiari says
that Themistocles died a natural death at Magnesia,
admitting, however, that there was a report that
he had poisoned himself, because he despaired of
being able to keep his promises to the king with
regard to the subjugation of Greece. Thucydides
has also stated that Themistocles’ bones were buried
in Attica by his friends secretly, since his interment
there was contrary to law, because he had been
found guilty of treason.

⁴ That is, Magnesia.
