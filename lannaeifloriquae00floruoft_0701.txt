XXV. A'ITICUS, xw. 1—xv. 2

of entertainment, at least in my opinion3 and dinner
was never served at his house without reading of some
kind, so that his guests enjoyed the gratification ot
the mind as well as of the appetite. For he invited
those whose tastes did not differ from his own. then
that great addition was made to his fortune,1 he made
no change in his daily habits, none in his manner of
life; in fact, he showed such moderation that he did
not livewithout distinction on the two million sesterces
which he received from his father, nor on ten millions
more extravagantly than before3 but he maintained
the same elevation with both fortunes. He had no

the sea, no country estates in Italy except his pro·
perties at Arretium and Nomentum3 all his income
came from his possessions in Epirus and in the city
of Rome. From this it can be seen that it was his
habit to regulate his expenses, not by the amount
of his wealth‚ but by reason.

Hence his affability was tempered with austerity
and his dignity by good-nature, so that it was diffi-
cult to know whether his friends felt for him greater
love or respect. thenever anything was requested
of him, he was circumspect in promising, because
he thought that to make a promise that one could
not keep was a mark of weakness rather than of
generosity. He was also so careful in endeavouring
to carry through what he had once consented to under-
* take, that he seemed to be attending, not to another’s
commission, but to an affair of his own. He never
wearied of an enterprise which he had once under-
taken3 for he thought that his own reputation was
involved, and there was nothing that he held dearer.
