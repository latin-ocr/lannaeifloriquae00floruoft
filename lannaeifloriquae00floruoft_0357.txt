BOOK II. xxx.

Drusus was sent into the province and conquered
the Usipetes first, and then overran the territory of
the Teneturi and Catthi. He erected‚ by way of a
trophy, a high mound adorned with the spoils and
decorations of the Marcomanni. N ext he attacked
simultaneously those powerful tribes, the Cherusci,
Suebi and Sicambri, who had begun hostilities after
crucifying twenty of our centurions, an act which
served as an oath binding them together, and with
such confidence of victory that they made an agree-
ment in anticipation for dividing the spoils. The
Cherusci had chosen the horses, the Suebi the gold
and silver, the Sicambri the captives. Everything,
however, turned out contrariwise3 for Drusus, after
defeating them, divided up their horses, their herds,
their necklets and their own persons as spoil and
sold them. Furthermore, to secure the province he
posted gai-risons and guard—posts all along the Meuse,
Elbe and Weser. Along the banks of the Rhine he
disposed more than five hundred forts. He built
bridges at Borma and Gesoriacum, and left fleets to
protect them. He opened a way through the Her-
cynian forest, which had never before been visited
or traversed. In a word, there was such peace in
Germany that the inhabitants seemed changed, the
face of the country transformed, and the very climate
milder and softer than it used to be. Lastly, when
the gallant young general had died there,the senate
itself, not from flattery but as an acknowledgment
of his merit, did him the unparalleled honour of
bestowing upon him a surname derived from the
name of a province.
