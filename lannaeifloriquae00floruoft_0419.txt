II. THEMISTOCLES, VI. 4—V11. 3

present, the Athenians desisted, saying that they
would send envoys to Lacedaemon to discuss the
matter. That mission Themistocles undertook and
set out at first alone, giving orders that the rest of
the envoys should not follow until the walls seemed
to have risen high enough to defend: that in the
meantime all, bond and free, should push the work,
sparing no place, whether sacred or public or private,1
but getting together from every hand whatever
they thought suitable for a fortification. That is
the reason why the walls of Athens were made of
shrines and tombs.

7. But when Themistocles came to Lacedaemon,
he at first refused to appear before the magistrates,
and did his best to gain as much time as possible,
pretending that he was waiting for his colleagues.
While the Lacedaemonians were protesting that the
work was going on just the same, and that he was
trying to deceive them about it, meanwhile the rest of
the envoys arrived. When Themistocles heard from
them that not much of the fortification remained
unfinished, he went before the ephors of the Lacedae-
monians, in whose hands was the supreme power, and
declared in their presence that they had been mis-
informed: therefore it was just that they should
send reliable men of high position, in whom they
had confidence, to investigate the matter3 in the
meantime they might hold him as a hostage. His
proposition was accepted, and three deputies, who
had held the highest offices‚ were sent to Athens.
Themistocles directed his colleagues to return with
them and charged them not to allow the envoys of
the Lacedaemonians to return, until he himself had

been sent back.
