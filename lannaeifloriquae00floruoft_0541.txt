affect the soldiers' spirits. He arrived at his
destination and pitched his camp in such a position
that he could not be surrounded by the superior

his own force ready for battle.

He had with him Mithrobarzanes, his father-in-

the enemy would be unable to resist, since they would
be assailed inside and outside of their intrenchments.
XVhen this idea met with favour, he led out his army
and pursued Mithrobarzanes ; and when the deserter
had reached the enemy, Datames gave the order to
attack. The Pisidians, surprised by this strange
manoeuvre, were led to believe that the deserters had

what was going on or why it was done, they were
forced to fight against those to whom they had
deserted and side with those whom they had aban-
