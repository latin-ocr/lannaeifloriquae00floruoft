IV. PAUSANIAS, 1. 1-11. 2

' IV. PAUSANIAS

1. Pausanias the Lacedaemonian was a great
man, but untrustworthy in all the relations of life;
for while he possessed conspicuous merits, yet he
was overloaded with defects. His most famous
exploit was the battle of Plataea; for it was under
his command that Mardonius, a Mede by birth,
satrap and son-in-law of the king,1 among the first
of all the Persians in deeds of arms and wise counsel,
with an army of two hundred thousand foot-soldiers
that he himself had selected man by man, and
twenty thousand horsemen, was routed by a com-
paratively small force of Greeks3 and in that battle
the leader himself fell. Puffed up by this victory,
Pausanias began to engage in numerous intrigues
and form ambitious designs. But first of all he
incurred criticism by consecrating at Delphi from
the spoils a golden tripod, on which was a metrical
inscription to this purport: that it was under his lead
that the barbarians had been destroyed at Plataea
and that because of that victory he gave that gift
to Apollo. Those verses the Lacedaemonians erased
and put in their place only the names of the cities
with whose help the Persians had been defeated.2

2. After that battle Pausanias again commanded
the allied Greeks, being sent with a fleet to Cyprus
and the Hellespont to dislodge the garrisons of the
barbarians from those regionS. Having enjoyed
equal good fortune in that expedition, he began to
act still more arrogantly and to entertain still loftier
ambitions. In fact, having at the taking of Byzantium
captured several Persian nobles, including some

stantinople. Thucydides (i. 132. 2) does not say that the
tripod was of gold3 that adjective is fiom Diodorus (xi. 33).
