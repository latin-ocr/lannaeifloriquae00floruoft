VII. ALCIBIADES, vi. 1—4

6. The whole city went down to the Piraeus to
meet them3 but so strong and so universal was the
desire of seeing Alcibiades that the people gathered
about his trireme exactly as if he had come alone.
In fact, the people were convinced that it was to

33) says that golden crowns were given him in the assembly,
and since fillets (or ribbons; Suet. N ero 25. 2) were common
offerings, while bronze crowns are not mentioned anywhere,
1 have read coronis aureis taeniisque ; see crit. note.
