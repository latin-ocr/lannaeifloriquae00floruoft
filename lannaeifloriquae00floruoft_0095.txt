BOOK Ι. xvu.

two daughters, one of whom he had given in
marriage to Sulpicius, a man of patrician blood,
while Stolo, a plebeian, had wedded the other. The
wife of the latter having been the object of some-
what insolent laughter on the part of her sister
because she had been alarmed by the sound of the
lictor’s staff (a sound which was unfamiliar to her
in her own home), Stolo could not endure the
affront. And so, when he obtained the tribunate,
he extorted from the senate, against their will, a
share in public offices and magistracies.

Even in these insurrections one may admire, not
without good reason, this sovereign people, since
at one time it championed liberty, at another
chastity, at another the dignity of birth, at another
the right to distinctions and insignia of office, and
among all these things was a zealous upholder of
nothing so much as of liberty, and could not be
corrupted by any kind of bribery to put it up for
sale, although, as was to be expected in a large and
daily increasing community, dangerous citizens arose
from time to time. The people punished by im-
mediate execution Spurius and Cassius, who were
suspected of aiming at the royal power, the former
through his excessive largesses‚ the latter by his
agrarian law. The punishment of Spurius was
undertaken by his own father, while Cassius was
stabbed in the middle of the forum at the order
of Quinctius, the dictator, by Servilius Ahala, the
master of the horse. Manlius too, the saviour of
the Capitol, they hurled from the very citadel which
116 had himself defended, when 116 began to behave
in a manner too arrogant and ill-fitting a private
citizen on the strength of having set free a number
of debtors.
