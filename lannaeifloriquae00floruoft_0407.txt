I. MILTIADES, vn. 5—V111. 4

accomplishing his purpose. At the time Miltiades
was disabled by wounds which he had suffered in
the attack on the town, and since for that reason he
could not plead his own cause, his brother Stesagoras
spoke in his behalf. When the trial was concluded,
Miltiades was not condemned to capital punish-
ment, but to pay a fine, the *amount of which was
fixed at five hundred talents, the sum which had
been spent on the fleet under his command. Since
he could not pay the fine at once, he was put in the
state prison, and there met his end}

8. Although it was the affair of Paros that led
to the accusation of Miltiades, there was another
reason for his condemnation3 for the Athenians,
because of the tyranny which Pisistratus had held
some years before,2 dreaded excessive power in
the hands of any citizen. They did not think it
possible that Miltiades, who had held so many and
such important military commands, would be able
to conduct himself as a private citizen, especially
since habit seemed to have given him a taste for
power. In the Chersonesus, for example, during
all the years of his residence there he had enjoyed
uninterrupted sovereignty. He had been called
tyrant, but he was a just one, since he owed his
power, not to force, but to the consent of his sub-
jects, and retained it as a result of his virtue. But
all men are called tyrants, and regarded as such,
who hold permanent rule in a city which has enj oyed
a democratic form of government. But in Miltiades
there was not only the greatest kindliness, but also
such remarkable condescension that no one was so

² Pisistratus and his sons Hippias and Hipparchus were
tyrants from 560 ῖο 510 B.c.
