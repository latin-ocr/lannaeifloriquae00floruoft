added remarkable instances of good luck. Thus he
fought his most important battles without exception
on his birthday, and in consequence all Sicily cele-
brated that day as a public festival. Once when a
certain Laphystius‚ a quarrelsome and ungrateful
fellow, wished to issue a summons against him,
saying that he desired to go to law with him,
many citizens had come together and were attempt-
ing to check the man's effrontery by force; but
Timoleon begged them all to desist, saying that
this was just the reason why he had undergone
great toil and extreme danger, in order that
Laphystius, or anyone else, might be allowed to do
just that thing. For that was the ideal of liberty,
when all were allowed to resort to law for any purpose
that anyone wished. Again, when a man like
Laphystius, Demaenetus by name, in an assembly
of the people had begun to disparage Timoleon’s acts
and made some attacks upon him, he declared that
at last his vow was fulfilled 3 for he had always prayed
the immortal gods to restore such liberty to the Syra-
cusans that anyone might be allowed with impunity
to say what he wished on any subject he wished.
then he ended his life, he was buried at public
expense by the Syracusans in the gymnasium called
Timoleonteum,1 and all Sicily attended his funeral.
