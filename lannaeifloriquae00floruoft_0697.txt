XXV. A'ITICUS, x11. 3-X111. 2

a Roman knight of the same age as Atticus, who
because of his devotion to philosophy had lived for
several years in Athens, had valuable possessions in
Italy. When the triumvirs sold his property, after
the manner in which things were done at that time,
it was due to the efforts and energy of Atticus that
the same messenger brought Saufeius news of the
loss of his property and of its recovery. He was
equally helpful to Lucius Julius Calidus‚ who since
the death of Lucretius and Catullus is, I think I may
truly say, by far the most graceful poet that our age
has produced, in addition to being a good man and
endowed with the highest culture. This Calidus‚
after the proscription of the knights was completed,
because of his extensive possessions in Africa was
added to the list by Publius Volumnius, Antony's
chief of engineers, although he was out of the country 3
but he was saved by Atticus. VVhether this conduct
caused Atticus more trouble at the moment or gave
him greater glory, it is not easy to decide, since at
the time of the perils of these men it became known
that his friends, whether present or absent, were the
object of his care.

13. And indeed this great man was considered 1 to
be as good as head of a family as he was as a citizen.
For although he had an abundance of money, no
one was less inclined to excess in buying or in build-
ing. At the same time, he had as fine a dwelling as
anyone, and he enjoyed the best of everything.
He had his home on the Quirinal in the villa built by
Tamphilus, which was lest him in his uncle’s will,
the charm of which consisted less in its construction
than in its park3 for the building itself was put up
in early times and was rather tasteful than costly.
