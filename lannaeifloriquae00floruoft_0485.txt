VIII. THRASYBULUS, 111. 1—1v. 3

that the administration of the government should be
restored to the people. Another noble action of
Thrasybulus was this: when peace was made and he
held the chief power at Athens, he proposed a law
providing that with reference to what had been done
in the past no one should be accused or punished 3 and
they called that law ‘⁴ the law of amnesty.'' 1 And
he not only saw to it that the law was passed, but
also that it was enforced3 for whenever anyone of
those who had been in exile with him wished to put
to death those who had been officially pardoned, he
prevented it and remained true to what he had
promised.

4. In recognition of these great services he was
presented by the people with an honorary crown
made of two olive—branches. And since that crown
was a token of the love of his fellow-citizens and was
not wrung from them by force, it excited no envy,
but brought him great glory. For Pittacus, who was
numbered among the Seven Sages, well said, when
the people of Mytilene wished to make him a present
of many thousand acres of land: “ Do not, Ι beg of
you, give me a gift that may excite the jealousy of
many and the cupidity of still more. But out of
what you offer I desire no more than one hundred
acres,2 which will be a token of my moderation and
your good-will.'' And indeed, as a rule, small gifts
are lasting, lavish ones are not permanent. So with
that crown Thrasybulus was content3 he asked for
nothing more, and he thought that no one was more

² The iuqerum was a Roman measure equal to about two-
thirds of an acre; according to Plutarch, Pittacus measured
the amount which he would accept by the distance that he
could hurl a spear.
