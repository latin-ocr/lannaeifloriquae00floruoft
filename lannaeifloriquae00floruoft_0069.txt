of gold, which gave their name to the family of the
Torquati. On another occasion, in the Pomptine
territory, in a similar fight Valerius, aided by a
sacred bird which settled on his helmet, won spoils
from the foe, and from this incident the Corvini
derived their name.1 Moreover, some years later,
near the Lake of Vadimo in Etruria, Dolabella
destroyed all that remained of the tribe, so that
none might survive of the race to boast that he had
burnt the city of Rome.

VIIII. Tm: LAT1N WAn

14. IN the consulship of Manlius Torquatus and
Decius Mus,² the Romans turned their attention
from the Gauls to the Latins, who, always their
foes through rivalry of empire, at this time, in their
contempt for the burnt city, demanded the rights
of citizenship and a share in the government and
public offices, and dared to meet them in battle at
Capua. Who will wonder that on this occasion the
enemy yielded, when one of the consuls put his
own son to death, though he had been victorious,
because he had fought against his order (thus
showing that to enforce obedience was more important
than victory), while the other consul, as though acting
upon a warning from heaven, with veiled head de-
voted himself to the infernal gods in front of the
army, in order that, by hurling himself where the
enemy's weapons were *hickest, he might open up a
new path to victory along the track of his own life-
blood?
