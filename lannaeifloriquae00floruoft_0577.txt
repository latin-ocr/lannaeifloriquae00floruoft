XVI. PELOPIDAS, 1v. 2—v. 5

leader of the select corps 1 that was first to break the
Lacedaemonian phalanx. Moreover, he shared in all
his other dangers (thus in the attack on Sparta he
commanded one wing), and in order to hasten the
restoration of Messene, he went as an envoy to the
Persians.2 In short, he was one of the two great
citizens of Thebes, and although he was second, yet
he was next to Epaminondas.

5. But Pelopidas contended also with ill fortune ;
for in the beginning, as I have stated, he was driven
from his country into exile, and when he wished to
bring Thessaly under the sway of Thebes and thought 368 ao.
that he was amply protected by the inviolability of
ambassadors, since that was observed sacredly by all
nations, he was arrested with Ismenias by Alexander,
tyrant of Pherae, and thrown into prison. He
was rescued by Epaminondas, who made war upon
Alexander. After that experience Pelopidas could
never be reconciled vss'th the man who had outraged
him, and it was for that reason that he persuaded the
Thebans to go to the aid of Thessaly and free it of its
tyrants. W⁷hen he had been given the chief command
in that war and had set out with his army, he did not
hesitate to join battle immediately on catching sight
of the enemy. In the action that followed, inflamed
with wrath at the very first sight of Alexander, he
spurred his horse against the tyrant, and being thus
separated some distance from his men, he fell,
struck down by a shower of weapons. This hap-
pened in the full tide of victory, for the tyrants’ forces
had already given way. Because of that exploit all
the states of Thessaly presented the dead Pelopidas
with crowns of gold and statues of bronze, and his
children with a great amount of land.
