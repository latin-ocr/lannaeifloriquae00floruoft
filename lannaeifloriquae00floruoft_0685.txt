XXV. ATTICUS, VI. 5-v111. 3

they saw that they were inspired by a desire to be
of service and not by sear or hope.

’7. Caesar’s civil war broke out when Atticus was 4913,st
about sixty years old. He took advantage of the
exemption due his years and did not stir from the
city. VVhatever his friends needed when they went
out to join Pompey he supplied from his own means,
and he escaped giving offence to Pompey himself.l
He had no emolument at his friend's hands, as
the rest had who through him had gained either
offices or richeS, some of whom joined his army most
reluctantly, while others bitterly offended him by
remaining at home. Moreover, Atticus' neutrality
so gratified Caesar, that after his victory, when he
made written demand of contributions from private
citizens, he not only caused Atticus no trouble,
but even granted to his entreaties the pardon of his
nephew and of Quintus Cicero, who were in Pompey's
camp. Thus by the long—standing policy of his life
he avoided the new dangers.

8. There followed that period after the death of 44 ac.
Caesar, when the government was apparently in the
hands of the Brutuses² and Cassius, and all the state
seemed to have espoused their cause. Atticus’ rela-
tions with Marcus Brutus were such, that there were
none of his own age with whom the younger man was
more intimate than with the old knight,3 whom he
made, not only his chief adviser, but also his boon
companion. Certain men had formed the plan of
making up a private fund for the assassins of Caesar
through the Roman knights. They thought that
their purpose could easily be effected‚ if the leading
men of that order would contribute. Accordingly,

³ Brutus was thirty-four, and Atticus was thirty-one years
his senior.
