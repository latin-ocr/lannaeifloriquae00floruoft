XVIII, EUMENES, 111. 2—1v. 2

Egypt, to war against Ptolemy. The troops of
Eumenes were neither numerous nor strong, since
they had been enrolled not long before and lacked
training3 moreover, it was said that Antipater and
Craterus, two men eminent both for their renown and
their military experience, had crossed the Hellespont
with a great army of Macedonians. In those days
the Macedonian soldiers had the reputation that the
Romans now enjoy, since those have always been
regarded as of the greatest valour who rule the whole
world, and Eumenes understood that if his troops
knew against whom they were being led, they would
not only refuse to go, but immediately on hearing
the news would melt away.

It therefore seemed wisest to lead the soldiers
over by—ways, where they could not learn the truth,
and make them believe that they were marching
against some barbarian tribe or other. And so well
did Eumenes carry out this plan, that his army was
already drawn up and had begun the battle before
the soldiers knew with whom they were to fight.
He also, by choosing his ground in advance of the
enemy, made the brunt of the battle fall on his
cavalry, in which he was the stronger, rather than
on the infantry, in which he was inferior.

fierce struggle, in which Craterus fell, the leader
of the enemy, as well as Neoptolemus, who was
second in command. With the latter Eumenes fought
hand to hand. When the two had grappled and had
fallen from their horses to the ground, it could
easily be seen that they were personal enemies, and
that their contest was one of the spirit even more
than of body3 for they could not be separated until
