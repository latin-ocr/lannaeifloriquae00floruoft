FRAGMENTS, 1. 2—111. 1

Jupiter forbid you to persist in that course or to allow
such madness to enter your mind. But if you do
persist‚ I fear that through your own fault you may
bring such trouble upon your whole life that you can
never make peace with yourself.

3 2. Eulogy of Cicero from the book of Cornelius

ἶ Nepos on the Latin Historians.

⁶¹? 1. You ought not to be unaw are that this1 is the
only branch of Latin literature that ev en in my own
time cannot be compared with what the Greeks
accomplished, and that it was left wholly rude and un-
finjshed by the death of Cicero. For he was the only
man who could, or even sought to, give history a
worthy utterance, since he highly polished the rude
eloquence handed down from our forefathers, and
gave Latin philosophy, which before his time was
uncouth, the finish of his style. Which leads me to
doubt whether his loss brought greater grief to our
country or to history.

2. Another extract from the same :

Bountiful and divine mother Nature, in order to
win greater admiration and make a better distribu-
tion of her gifts, has chosen neither to give every-
thing to one man, nor, on the contrary, to refuse
everything to anyone.

3. Cornelius Nepos wrote as follows to Cicero:

So far am Ι from thinking that philosophy can teach
how to live and is the perfecter of a happy life, that
I believe that none have more need of learning how
to live than the greater number of those who are
engaged in teaching philosophy. In fact, I observe
that a great part of those same men who in the schools
argue most subtly about moderation and self-restraint
pass their lives a prey to all the passions.
