XXV. ATI'ICUS, lv, 5—V1. 1

sesterces. After calm had been established at Rome

he returned to the city, in the consulship, Ι believe,l

of Lucius Cotta and Lucius Torquatus. When he left 65 1³·0·
Athens, all the citizens attended ² him, showing

by tears the grief that they would feel at losing
him.

5. His maternal uncle was Quintus Caecilius, a
Roman knight and a friend of Lucius Lucullus, rich
but very hard to please. Atticus treated the sour-
tempered old man with such deference, that although
no one else could endure him, his nephew retained
his good—will without giving him any offence until he
reached extreme old age. By such conduct he reaped
the fruits of his devotion3 for Caecilius on his death· 5-3 ΒΕ.
bed adopted him by will and made him heir to three-
fourths of his estate3 and his share came to about
ten million sesterces. Atticus' sister was married to
Quintus Tullius Cicer03 the marriage was arranged
by Marcus Cicero, with whom Atticus had lived in the
closest intimacy from the time when they were
schoolfellows‚ much more intimately than with
Quintus; which shows that likeness of character is of
more weight in friendship than family alliances.
He was also a close friend of Quintus Hortensius,
who in those days held the first rank in eloquence—
so dear a friend that it was uncertain which loved
him the better, Cicero or Hortensius. He even
accomplished the difficult task of preventing any ill-
feeling between those rivals for a position of such
glory,³ and was the bond of union between those great
men.

6. In public life he so conducted himself as always

² On his way to the ship.
³ That is, the first rank in eloquence.
