INTRODUCTION

important corrections in the eleventh or twelfth
centur .

TheyCodex Bambergensis stands in a class by itself;
the other existing MSS. belong to one family. The
oldest of these is the Codex Palatinus Latinus 894 (N),
formerly in the Library of the Monastery of St.
Nazarius at Lorsch, and therefore often known as
the Codex Nazarianus. It is written on parchment
and dates from the end of the ninth century. It
has corrections, no doubt taken from the same arche-
type, by the same hand that wrote the original, and
by a later hand of the twelfth century which some-
times emends small errors but more often introduces
corrupt readings. It has been collated by Jahn (in
a somewhat summary manner), by VVolflinn and by
Rossbach

The third MS. of first-rate importance is the
Codex Leidensis Vossianus 14 (L), written on parch-
ment in a fine hand of the eleventh century. It is
closely related to N, but contains too many dis-
crepancies to be derived directly from it.

Other MSS. of the same class are :—

The Codex Palatinus Heidelbergensis 1568 (Palm.)
of the eleventh century;

The Codex Harleianns 2620 (Harl), in the British
Museum, of the thirteenth century;

The Codex Monacensis 6392 (Monac.) of the
eleventh century;

The Codex Parisinus 5802 (Paris. 5802), which is
known to have been used by Petrarch, and

the Codes: Parisinus 7701 (PariS. 7701), both
of the twelfth century.

The Codex Leidensis Vossianus 77 (Voss) ,· and
