BOOK 1. xxn.

against them, he himself fought with the elements
on his side, aided by the wind, the dust and the
sun. Thus two great Roman armies were slaughtered
till the enemy were satiated and Hannibal bade his
soldiers stay their swords. One of our generals fied,
the other was captured. It is difficult to decide
which showed the greater courage: Paulus, who
was ashamed to survive, or Varro, who refused to
despair. As proofs of the vastness of the slaughter
the Aufidus for a long time ran with blood3 a bridge
of corpses was constructed by order of the general
over the torrent of Vergellus3 two pecks of rings
were sent to Carthago and the services of the
equestrian order thus estimated by measure. After
this no doubt will be entertained that Rome would
have seen its last day and Hannibal might within
five days have feasted on the Capitol, if (as they say
Maharbal, the Carthaginian, the son of Bomilcar,
. observed) he had known how to use his victory as
well as he knew how to obtain it. However, at
the time, as is generally said, either the destiny of
Rome as the future ruler of the world, or Hannibal’s
mistaken judgment, and the hostility of the gods to
Carthage, diverted him elsewhere. When he might
have exploited his victory, he preferred the enjoy-
ments which it offered and, neglecting Rome,
marched to Campania and Tarentum, where the
vigour both of himself and of his army soon
languished to such an extent that it has been
remarked with truth that “Capua was Hannibal's
Cannae.” For, though it is scarcely credible, the
sunshine of Campania and the hot springs of Baiae
overcame him who had been undefeated by the
Alps and unconquered on the battle-field.
