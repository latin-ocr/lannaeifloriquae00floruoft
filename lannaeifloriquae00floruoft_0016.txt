THE Tnxr

It is now generally recognized that the best MS.
of Florus is the Codex Bambergensis E ΙΙΙ 22 (Β),
which dates from the beginning of the ninth century.
Its importance was first pointed out by Seebode
in 1821, but Otto Jahn was the first editor to make
full use of it in the Teubner edition of 1852. It
has also been collated by Halm and Rossbach. It
is written on parchment and contains also the
Historjy of Dares Phrygius and the Breviarium of
Festus.

The Codex Bambergensis ends abruptly at profundo,
ten words before the end of ΙΙ, 33, and the pre-
ceding passage beginning at recrmeatus twenty· -six
words before the end of ΙΙ, 32, is written in rather
darker ink by a later hand (Bl), which also added
several omitted passages (Ι, Introduction 1, Populus
to 3, videantur ,· ΙΙ, 1, 1, seditionum to 2, gentium,-
ΙΙ, 29, sarmatae to pacem ,· ΙΙ, 30, 34, tres legiones to
36, patronos ; ΙΙ, 31, Haec to victoria ficit, and
inserted the headings and lists of chapters, besides
making minor corrections throughout the text. It
seems certain that 131 had the same original before
him, adding passages where B had been unable
to decipher the MS, and making corrections
where B had erred3 his readings, therefore, are
to be regarded as worthy of every consideration.
Another hand (13²) made a smaller number of less
