II. THEMISTOCLES, 11. 8-1v. 2

number of triremes, and transported all their movable
property either to Salamis or Troezene. The citadel
they left in charge of the priests and a few of the
older citizens, who were to attend to the sacred
rites3 the rest of the city they abandoned.

3. Many of the states did not approve of Themisto-
cles’ plan, but preferred to fight on land. Accord-
ingly, a band of picked men was sent with Leonidas,
king of the Lacedaemonians, to hold Thermopylae
and prevent any further advance of the barbarians.
They, however, could not resist the enemy’s attack‚
but in that pass they all perished. But the common
fleet of Greece, consisting of three hundred ships,
of which two hundred belonged to Athens, first
engaged with the king’s marines off Artemisium,
between Euboea and the mainland. For Themisto-
cles chose a narrow place, in order not to be sur-
rounded by superior numbers. Although the result
of that battle was indecisive, the Greeks neverthe-
less did not venture to hold their ground, because
there was reason to fear that if a part of the ships
of their opponents should round Euboea, they would
be exposed to attack on both sides. They therefore
retired from Artemisium and stationed their fleet
at Salamis, over against Athens.

4. Now Xerxes, having forced the pass at Thermo-
pylae, at once marched upon Athens, and since it
was without defenders, he massacred the priests
whom he found on the citadel and destroyed the
city by fire. The flames of the burning town so
terrified the soldiers on the fleet, that they did not
dare to hold their position, but the greater number
recommended withdrawing to their homes and
taking refuge within their walls. Tbemistocles
