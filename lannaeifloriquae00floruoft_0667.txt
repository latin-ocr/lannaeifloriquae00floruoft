XXIII. HANNIBAL, ΧΠ, 5-Χ111. 4

The slave having quickly reported the facts and told
him that all the exits were guarded, Hannibal
knew that it was no accident; that it uas he whom
they were after and he must no longer think of
preserving his life. But not wishing to lose it at
another‘s will, and remembering his past deeds of
valour, he took the poison which he always carried
about his person.1

13. Thus that bravest of men, after having per-
formed many and varied labours, entered into rest
in his seventieth 2 year. Under what consuls he died
is disputed. For Atticus has recorded in his Annals 3
that he died in the consulate of Marcus Claudius 1831311.
Marcellus and Quintus Fabius Labeo; Polybius, 182 ac.
under Lucius Aemilius Paulus and Gnaeus Baebius 181 ac.
Tamphilus3 and Sulpicius Blitho, in the time of
PublIus Cornelius Cethegus and Marcus Baebius Tam-
philus. And that great man, although busied with
such great wars, devoted some time to letters3 for
there are several books of his, written in Greek,
among them one, addressed to the Rhodians, on the
deeds of Gnaeus Manlius Volso in Asia.4 Hannibal's
deeds of arms have been recorded by many writers,
, among them two men who were with him in camp and
lived with him so long as fortune allowed, Silenus
and Sosylus of Lacedaemon. And it was this Sosylus
whom Hannibal employed as his teacher of Greek.

But it is time for us to put an end to this book and
give an account of the Roman generals, to make it
possible by comparing their deeds with those of the
foreigners to judge which heroes ought to be given
the higher rank.

Antiochus. The Rhodjans had joined with the Romans in
the campaigns.
