VII. ALCIBIADES, vm. 4—1x. 3

do what he asked‚ because he saw that if the exile
were taken back, he himself would be of no import-
ance in the army3 also that in the event of success
he would be given no credit, while if any reverse
was suffered, he alone would be held responsible.
As he left him, Alcibiades said: ‘⁴ Since you do not
wish victory for your country, I give you this bit of
advice3 do not keep your naval camp near the
enemy3 for there is reason to fear that the lack of
discipline of your soldiers may give Lysander an
opportunity of crushing 3our a1m3. ’² And he W as
not mistaken3 for when L3 sander had learned
through scouts that a great part of the Athenian
soldiers had gone ashore to pillage, lea31ng the
ships almost empty, he did not let the chance for
action slip, and by his attack he brought the whole
war to an end.

9. But Alcibiades, thinking that after the defeat
of the Athenians he was not altogether safe in his
present residence, withdrew far into Thrace and went
into hiding beyond the Propontis, thinking that there
his existence might most easily be concealed. But
he was mistaken3 for as soon as the Thracians
learned that he had come there with a large amount
of money, they laid a trap for him; and they 33 ere
successful in carrying off 33 hat he had brought with
him, although they could not take the man himself.
Then, perceiving that no place in Greece 33 as safe
for him because of the power of the Lacedaemonians,
he took refuge in Asia with Pharnabazus, 33 hom 116
so captivated by his personal charm, that he became
the Persian's dearest friend. ΙΠ fact Pharnabazus
gave him Grynium, a stronghold of Phrygia, from
which he received a yearly revenue of fifty talents.
