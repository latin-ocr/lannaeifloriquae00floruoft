destroyed the camp of Publius1 Cassius at Mutina.
Elated by these victories he entertained the project—

supported by all the resources of the empire, against
this gladiator, and Licinius Crassus vindicated the
honour of Rome. Routed and put to fiight by him,

preparing to escape to Sicily, but being unable to

casks bound together with withies on the swift
waters of the straits. Failing in this attempt, they
finally made a sally and met a death worthy of men,
fighting to the death2 as became those who were
commanded by a gladiator. Spartacus himself fell,
as became a general, fighting most bravely in the
front rank.
