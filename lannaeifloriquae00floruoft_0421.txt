ΙΙ. THEMISTOCLES, vn. 4-v111. 2

As soon as he thought that the deputation had
reached Athens, he appeared before the magis—
trates 1 and the senate of the Lacedaemonians and
confessed to them with the utmost frankness that
the Athenians, by his advice, and taking advantage
of the rights granted by the common law of nations,
had encircled with walls the gods of all Greece, of
their native city and of their homes, in order the
more easily to defend them against the enemy;
and that in so doing they had acted for the best
interests of Greece. For their city, he said, was
like an outpost in the path of the barbarians, and
upon it the king’s fleets had already twice suffered
shipwreck. But the Lacedaemonians were acting
wrongfully and unjustly in having in view rather
what contributed to their own supremacy than to
the welfare of Greece as a whole. Therefore, if
they wished to recover their envoys which they had
sent to Athens, they must let him go3 otherwise
they would never get them back again in their
native land.

8. In spite of all, Hemistocles could not escape
the distrust of his fellow-citizens3 but because of
the same feeling of apprehension that had led to
the condemnation of Miltiades he was banished
from the city by the shard-vote 2 and went to live in
Argos. There because of his many accomplish-
ments he lived in great distinction, until the Lacedae-
monians sent envoys to Athens,3 to accuse him

exile of ten, later of five, years, but- without loss of rank or
property. If the number of votes did not amount to 6000,
no action was taken. Cf. V. 3. 1, where the Greek name
ὃστρακισμός is given.
