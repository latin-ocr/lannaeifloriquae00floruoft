BOOK II. xvu.

invincible good fortune both of the avenger and of
him who was being avenged supported their cause,
as the result of the battle proved. At first the issue
was so doubtful that, danger threatening both sides
alike, the camp of Caesar was captured on the one
hand and that of Cassius on the other. But how
much more powerful is fortune than valour, and how
true it is, as the dying Brutus said with his last
breath, that virtue exists not in reality but in name
only ! 1 A mistake decided the victory in this battle.
Cassius, at a moment when the wing of his army had
given way, on seeing the cavalry returning at full
speed after the capture of Caesar's camp, thought
that they were in flight and made his way to some
higher ground. Here, when the dust and confusion
and the approaching darkness prevented him from
seeing what had happened, and a scout whom he
had sent out to obtain news was slow in bringing it,
thinking that his cause was lost, he made one of
those who were standing by cut off his head. Brutus,
having lost his second self by the death of Cassius,
in order that he might not fail in carrying out every
detail of their compact (for it had been agreed that
neither of them should survive the battle), presented
his side to one of his companions that he might
plunge his sword into it. Who can but wonder
that these wise and brave men did not die by their
own hands ? But it was perhaps a further example
of their adherence to their philosophie principles,
that they should not stain their hands with blood,
but that, for the destruction of their brave and pious
lives, though the decision to die was their own, they
should employ the hands of others to execute the
crime.
