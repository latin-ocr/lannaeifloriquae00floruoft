XXI. ΟΝ KINGS, 1. 1-11. 1

unwilling to touch, because the history of all of them
has been related in another place.l But, after all,
these 2 are not very numerous. Now Agesilaus, the
Lacedaemonian, had the title, but not the power, of a
king, as was true of the other Spartans of that rank.
But of those who joined to their title absolute
dominion, the most eminent in my estimation were 55 S— 529
the Persians Cyrus and Darius, son of Hystaspes, both 521} 548
of whom were private citizens who attained royal BHG
power through merit. Of these the former fell in
battle in the land of the Massagetae3 Darius died of
old age. There are besides three other eminent kings
of the same nation: Xerxes and the two Artaxerxes, 485-464
surnamed Macrochir, or “ Long-hand,'' and Mnemon, ΒΕ·
or “ of Good Memory.”³ Xerxes owes his fame in
particular to having made war on Greece by land
and sea with the greatest armies within the memory
of man3 but Macrochir is principally known for his
imposing and handsome figure, which he enhanced
by incredible valour in war ; for no one of the Persians
excelled him in deeds of arms. Mnemon, on the
contrary, was celebrated for his justice; for when
he had lost his wife through the crime of his mother,
he confined the indulgence of his resentment within
the bounds of filial piety.4 Of these kings the two
that bore the same name paid their debt to nature
as the result of disease3 the third was murdered by
his prefect Artabanus.

2. Now, among the people of Macedonia two
kings far surpassed the rest in the glory of their
deeds: Philip, son of Amyntas, and Alexander the
