V. CIMON, 11. 5-1v. 2

of the booty1 he fortified the south side of the
Athenian Acropolis.

3. Having become through these exploits the most
distinguished man of his city, he incurred the same c. 461
distrust as his father and the other leading men of ¹³⁶⁰·
Athens, and by the shard-vote,2 which they call
ostracism, he was banished for a term of ten years.
But the Athenians repented of their action sooner
than he did himself 3 for after he had shown his
fortitude by yieldjng to the suspicions of his ungrate-
ful fellow-citizens, the Lacedaemonians began war
with the Athenians, who at once felt the need of
Cimon’s well-known prowess. Therefore Cimon was
recalled to his native land only four years after his
banishment. Then, having a guest-friendship 3 with
the Lacedaemonjans, and thinking it better to go to
Lacedaemon, he set out on his own responsibility
and brought about peace between two powerful
states.4 Asterwards, but not much later, being sent
as commander-in-chief to Cyprus with two hundred
ships, after conquering the greater part of the island
he was taken ill and died in the town of Citium.⁵

4. For a long time the Athenians missed Cimon,
not only in war, but in peace as well. For he was
so generous that, having estates and gardens in
numerous places, he never set a guard over them to
protect the fruits, since he did not wish to prevent
anyone from enjoying any part of his property that
he wished.⁶ Pages always followed him with money,

⁴ Cimon's recall was in 457 B.c., the peace with Lace-
daemon not until 451.

⁵ It was during the siege of that town in 449 B.C.

⁶ The same story is told by Aristotle‚ Ἀθ. Πολ. 27. 3, who
says that this liberality was a political device, to strengthen s
him against his chief rival, Pericles.
