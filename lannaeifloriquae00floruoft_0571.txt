XVI. PELOPIDAS

1. Pelopidas, the Theban, is better known to
historians than to the general public. Ι am in doubt
how to give an account of his merits; for Ι sear that
if I undertake to tell of his deeds, Ι shall seem to be
writing a history rather than a biography; but if I
merely touch upon the high points, I am afraid that to
those unfamiliar with Grecian literature it will not be
perfectly clear how great a man he was. Therefore
I shall meet both difficulties as well as Ι can, having
regard both for the weariness and the lack of informa-
tion of my readers.1

When Phoebidas, the Lacedaemonian, was leading
his army to Olynthus and went by way of Thebes, he 382 13.o
took possession of the citadel of the town, called
the Cadmea, at the instigation of a few Thebans, who,
in order the more easily to resist the party of their
opponents‚ espoused the cause of the Lacedaemo-
nians 3 but he did this on his own initiative and not at
the direction of his state. Because of this act the
Lacedaemonians deprived him of his command and
condemned him to pay a fine, but for all that they did
not return the citadel to the Thebans, thinking that,
having incurred their enmity, it was better to keep
them in a state of siege than to free them. Indeed, after
the Peloponnesian war and the defeat of Athens they
looked upon the Thebans as rivals and as the only
people that would dare to resist them. Oxw‘ng to
this feeling, they had given the highest offices at
Hebes to their sympathizers, and had either put to
death or exiled the leading men of the opposite
faction. Among these this Pelopidas, about whom
I have begun to write, had been driven from his
native land into exile.
