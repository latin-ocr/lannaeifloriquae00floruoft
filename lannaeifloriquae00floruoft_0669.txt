AN EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF CORNELIUS NEPOS ΟΝ
LATIN HISTORIANS

1. Marcus Cato, born in the town of Tusculum, in
his early youth, before entering on an official career,
lived in the land of the Sabines, since he had there
an hereditary property, left him by his father. Then,
with the encouragement of Lucius Valerius Flaccus,
later his colleague in the consulship and the censor-
ship—as Marcus Perpenna, the ex-censor, was fond of
mentioning—he moved to Rome and entered public
life. He served his first campaign at the age of 215 ac.
seventeen. In the consulate of Quintus Fabius and 12513.c.
Marcus Claudius he was tribune of the soldiers in
Sicily. On his return from there he joined the
army of Gaius Claudius Nero and won high praise in
the battle at Sena} in which Hasdrubal, the brother of
Hannibal, fell. As quaestor the chance of the lot
assigned him to the consul Publius Africanus,2 with
whom he did not live as the intimacy of their associa-
tion demanded ; 3 for he disagreed with him through-
out his whole life. He was chosen plebeian aedile 199 ac.
with Gaius Helvius. As praetor he was allotted the
province of Sardinia, from which at an earlier time, 198 ao.
when leaving Africa after his quaestor-ship, he had
brought the poet Ennius to Rome—an act which, in
my opinion, was no less glorious than the greatest
possible victory in Sardinia.4

2. He was consul with Lucius Valerius Flaccus, 195 B.c.
