of the antiquity of his family,1 the fame of his
ancestors, and his own unassuming nature, was the
most distinguished man of his day. He had reached

in his fellow—citizenS, but even gave them confidence
that he would be the kind of man that they

Chersonesus.2 Since the number of eligible citizens
was large and many wished to take part in that

him as their commander, declaring that if they djd

It was owing to that response of the oracle that
Miltiades, accompam'ed by a carefully selected
band, set sail with a fleet for the Chersonesus.
Having reached Lemnos 4 and wishing to bring the

Aeac-ide, Romanos vincere posse, given to King Pyrrhus of
Egfflgzbos everywhere has ‘che Latin forms of Greek names
and uses the Roman names for the Greek gods.
