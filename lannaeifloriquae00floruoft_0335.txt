in Carinae, the most fashionable quarter of the
capital, while his own home and his household gods
tossed in a ship. But owing to the incivility of
Antonius and because the spoil from Pompeius’
property, of which Antonius had been the purchaser,
had been squandered, the entry of Sextus into
possession of his estates could not be sustained;
thus Pompeius began to back out of the pact of
agreement. So recourse was had to arms again, and
a fleet was now equipped with all the resources of
the Empire against the young leader. Preparations
for it were made on a magnificent scale3 for by
cutting through the track of the Herculean WVay
and digging up the shore,2 the Lucrine Lake was
turned into a harbour and the Lake of Avernus
added to it by cutting away the ground between, in
order that manoeuvring on these quiet waters the
fleet might practise a semblance of naval warfare.
The young commander was brought to action by
this superior force and defeated in the Sicilian
straits, and would have carried with him to the
grave the reputation of a great leader if he had
attempted nothing further3 but it is a characteristic
of genius never to lose hope. When his position
became desperate, he fled away and made sail for
Asia, only to fall there into the hands of the enemy
and to suffer imprisonment and undergo the most
wretched fate which can befall a brave man,
namely, death by the sword of the executioner at the
bidding of his foes. There had been no such pitiable

the Lucrine Lake from the sea and carried the road (Via
Herculea) between Baiae and Puteoli.
