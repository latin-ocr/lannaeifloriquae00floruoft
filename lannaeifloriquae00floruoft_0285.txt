conspirators ought to be spared on account of their
position3 Cato thought that they ought to be

Though part of the conspiracy was thus put down,
Catiline did not abandon his designs; but, as he was
marching against the city from Etruria with hostile
intent, he was surprised by the army of Antonius.

was discovered far in front of his fellows amid the
dead bodies of his foes, thus dying a death which
would have been glorious if he had thus fallen
fighting for his country.
