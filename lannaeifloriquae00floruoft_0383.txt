INTRODUCTION

Owing to the lack of reliable manuscripts and the
fact that Nepos has been so extensively used in the
schools of ancient, as well as of modern, times,
editors have been very free in making emendations
and transpositions, and in assuming the existence of
lacunae. The extremes of conservatism and the
reverse are perhaps illustrated by the editions of
VVinsted and Guillemin. In this edition the manu-
script reading has been kept wherever it seemed
possible to do so3 in the words of VVinsted (Praef.):
“ Nepotis librum limatiorem quam ipse reliquit
reddere veritus sum.'' Deviations from the codices,
except in the case of obvious and generally accepted
corrections, have been indicated in the critical notes.
