among the ease-loving citizens. Metellus, because
his triumph over Crete was shorn of its splendour,2
and Cato, who always looked askance upon those in
power, began to decry Pompeius and clamour against
his measures, Annoyance at this drove Pompeius
into opposition and induced him to seek support for
his position. Crassus happened at this time to be

and the high offices which he had held, and yet he
wished to increase his richesÍ¾ Gaius Caesar's fame
for eloquence and courage was now enhanced by his
