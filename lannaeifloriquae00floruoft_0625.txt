XX. TIMOLEON

1. Timoleon, the Corinthian. without doubt this
man has shown himself great in the estimation of all.
For he alone had the good fortune, which I am
inclined to think fell to the lot of no one else, to
free the land of his birth from a tyrant's oppression,
to rescue the S3racusans, whom he had been sent to
help, from long· continued slav ery, and b3 his mere
arrival to rest01e all Sicily to its former condition,
after it had for many 3ears been harassed b3 wars
and subject to barbarians.

But in the course of these events he had to struggle
with varied fortune, and he djd what is regarded
as especially difficult, that is, showed himself far
wiser in pr‘ospeiity than in adversit3. For when
his brother Timophanes, who had been chosen general
by the Corinthians, made himself t3 rant with the
aid of mercenary troops,2 although Timoleon might
have shared in his power, so far was he from partici-
pating in the crime, that he valued the liberty of his
fellow-citizens above his brother's life and con-
sidered obedience to its laws preferable to ruling
over his country. Owing to that feeling, through
the aid of a soothsayer and of a relative by marriage,
the husband of their own sister, he caused the death
of the tyrant, his own brother. He himself not only
did not lay hands upon him, but he did not wish
even to look upon his brother's blood; for while
the deed was being done he was some distance
away, keeping guard to prevent any palace guard
from coming to the tyrant’s aid.
