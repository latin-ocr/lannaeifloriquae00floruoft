XIV. DATAMES, 1v. 3-v. 2

thought that he ought to do what the king desired.
He therefore embarked upon a ship, taking with
him only a few, but brave, soldiers, believing——as
turned out to be the case—that it would be easier to
crush his enemy with a small force by taking him off
his guard, than with any possible numbers when he
was ready to defend himself.

Sailing to Cilicia and disembarking there, Datames
marched day and night, crossed the Taurus, and
arrived at his destination‚ On inquiring where
Aspis was, he learned that he was not far off, and
that he had gone a-hunting. While Datames was
considering what to do, the reason for his arrival
became known, and Aspis prepared to resist him
with the Pisidians 1 in addition to the soldiers that
he had with him. When Datames heard of this,
he took up arms, ordered his men to follow3 he
himself rode at full speed to meet the enemy.
Aspis, catching sight of him afar off, as he rushed
upon him, was seized with fear, and abandoning any
thought of resistance, gave himself up. Datames
put him in irons and delivered him to Mithridates2
to be taken to the king.

to the army at Aee, telling him not to leav e the army3
but before the messenger arrived at his destination‚
he met on the way those that were bringing Aspis to
the king. Although by that rapid action Datames
gained high favour with Artaxerxes, he incurred
equally great Jealousy from the courtiers, because
they realized that he was more highly esteemed
