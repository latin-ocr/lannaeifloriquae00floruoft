xv. EPAMINONDAS, ιχ. 3-x. 4

he cried: “I have lived long enough, since I die
unconquered.” Then he drew out the iron and at
once breathed his last.

10. Epaminondas never took a wife. Because of
this he was criticized by Pelopidas,1 who had a son of
evil reputation; for his friend said that the great
Theban did a wrong to his country in not leaving
children. Epaminondas replied3 “ Take heed that
you do not do her a greater wrong in leaving such a
son as yours. And besides, I cannot lack offspring ;
for I leave as my daughter the battle of Leuctra,
which is certain, not merely to survive me, but even
to be immortal.'' When the exiles, led by Pelopidas,
took Thebes and drove the Lacedaemonian garrison
from the citadel, so long as the citizens were being
slain Epaminondas remained in his house,² since he
was unwilling either to aid the traitors or to fight
against them, from reluctance to stain his hands
with the blood of his countrymen3 for he thought
that every victory won in a civil war was pernicious.
But as soon as the combat began with the Lace-
daemonians at the Cadmea, he stood in the fore-
front.

Enough will have been said of this great man's
virtues and of his life, if Ι add this one thing, which
nobody m’ll deny. Before the birth of Epaminondas,
and after his death, Thebes was subject constantly to
the hegemony 3 of others; but, on the contrary, so
long as he was at the head of the state, she was the
leading city of all Greece. This fact shows that
one man was worth more than the entire body of
citizens.
