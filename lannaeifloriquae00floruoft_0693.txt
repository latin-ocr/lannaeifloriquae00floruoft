XXV. ATTICUS, x. 5—XI. 4

at night—he sent him an escort. Thus it was that
Atticus in a time of extreme anxiety saved not only
himself but also his dearest friend. For he did not
seek aid from anyone for his own safety alone, thus
making it clear that he desired no good fortune that
was not shared by his friend. But if that pilot is
extolled with the highest praise who saves his ship
from the storm in a rock-strewn sea, why should not
that man's skill be regarded as without parallel, who
from such numerous and terrible civil tempests comes
safe into port?

11. Once escaped from those evils, Atticus' sole
effort was to help as many as possible in whatever
manner he could. At a time when the rewards offered
by the triumvirs caused a general hounding of the
proscribed, no one came to Epirus 1 who djd not get
everything that he needed, no one who was not
given the opportunity of living there permanently.
N ay, more, after the battle of Philippi and the death 42 Μ
of Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus he undertook
to protect the ex-praetor Lucius Julius Mocilla and
his son, as well as Aulus Torquatus and the other
victims of the same ill-fortune, ordering that all
that they needed should be sent for them from
Epirus to Samothrace. It is difficult to enumerate
everything‚ and needless besides. This one thing I
wish to make clear, that his generosity was neither
time-serving nor calculated.2 This may be inferred
from the circumstances themselves and from the
times, because he never bought the favour of those
in power, but always succoured the afflicted; for
example, he showed no less regard to Servilia, the

² Here, as elsewhere, Nepos gives Atticus too much eredit.
