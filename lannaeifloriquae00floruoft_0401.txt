that place, and sent them to the king in Asia. Then
they kept on to Attica and led their forces into the
plain of Marathon, which is distant about ten miles
from Athens.

The Athenians, though greatly alarmed by this
hostile demonstration, so near and so threatening,
asked help only from the Lacedaemoniam, sending
Phidippus, a courier of the class known as “ all-day
runners,” 1 to report how pressing was their need of
aid. But at home they appointed ten generals to
command the army, including Miltiades; among
these there was great difference of opinion, whether
it were better to take refuge within their walls or
go to meet the enemy and fight a decisive battle.
Miltiades alone persistently urged them to take the
field at the earliest possible moment ; stating that if
they did so, not only would the citizens take heart,
when they saw that their courage was not distrusted,
but for the same reason the enemy would be slower
to act, if they realized that the Athenians dared
to engage them with so small a force.

5. In that crisis no city gave help to the Athenians
except the Plataeans. They sent a thousand
soldiers, whose arrival raised the number of com-
batants to ten thousand.2 It was a band infiamed
with a marvellous desire for battle, and their ardour
gave Miltiades’ advice preference over that of his
colleagues. Accordingly, through his influence the
Athenians were induced to lead their forces from
the city and encamp in a favourable position. Then,

and Sparta in 48 hours.

² This is what Nepos seems to say; but there were 10,000
Athenians and 1000 Plataeans.
