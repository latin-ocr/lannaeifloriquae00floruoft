XXV. ATTICUS, xv. 2—xvl1. 1

Hence it was that he managed all the business affairs
of the Ciceros, of Marcus Cato,1 of Quintus Horten-
sius, of Aulus Torquatus, and of many Roman knights
besides3 and from this it may be judged that it was
not from indolence, but from conviction that he held
aloof from affairs of state.

16. To his amiability I can bring no stronger testi-
mony than to say that when he was a young man he
was greatly beloved by the aged Sulla, and when he
was old, by the young Marcus Brutus3 and with the
men of his own age, Quintus Hortensius and Marcus
Cicero, his relations were such that it is difficult to
determine with what time of life he was most con-
gem‘al. And yet it was Cicero who loved him more
than all others, so much so that not even his brother
Quintus was dearer to the orator or more intimate.
This is shown, not only by those published works in
which Cicero mentions him, but also by the sixteen
volumes of letters sent to Atticus from the time of
his consulship to the end of his life.2 One who reads
these does not feel great need of a connected history
of those times3 for such complete details are given of
the rivalry of the chief men, the faults of the leaders,
the changes of government, that there is nothing
that they do not make clear, and it may readily appear
that Cicero's foresight was almost divination. For he
not only predicted the events that actually happened
during his lifetime, but, like a seer, foretold those
which are now being experienced.3

17. Why should I say more about Atticus' devotion
to his family than this? He himself, in my hearing,

² Reany, from 68 13.c., five years after the consulship, to
44 B.c.‚ the year before Cicero's death.
³ This, like many of Nepos' statements, is exaggerated.
