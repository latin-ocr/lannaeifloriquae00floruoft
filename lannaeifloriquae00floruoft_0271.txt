BOOK 11. vnn.

driven by violence, Marius might seem to have acted
justly, but that he disgraced his cause by cruelty.
But returning at enmity with gods and men, he
directed his first onslaught against Ostia, a city
dependent upon Rome, and her foster-child, which
he laid waste with impious destruction. Soon after-
wards the city was entered by four detachments
distributed under the command of Cinna, Marius,
Carbo and Sertorius. When all Octavius' troops had
been dislodged from the Janiculum, immediately,
at a given signal, they wreaked their fury in the
slaughter of the leading citizens with even greater
cruelty than even in a Carthaginian city. The
head of the consul Octavius was displayed on the
rostra, that of Antonius, an ex-consul, on Marius'
own table. Caesar and Fimbria were butchered at
the household shrines of their own homes. The
elder and younger Crassus were slain in the
sight of one another. Baebius and Numitorius
were dragged through the forum on the hooks of
the executioners. Catulus saved himself from the
insults of his enemies by swallowing fire. Merula,
the priest of Jupiter in the Capitol, bespattered the
visage of the god himself with the blood from his
veins. Ancharius was stabbed in the presence of
Marius himself, because, forsooth, when he saluted
him, Marius had not stretched out to him the hand
which was to decide his fate.¹ All these deaths of
senators were the result of Marius’ seventh consul-
ship2 between the lst and the 9th of January.
What would have happened if he had completed his
full year of office?

In the consulship of Scipio and Norbanus,³ the
third storm of civil rage broke forth in all its fury.
