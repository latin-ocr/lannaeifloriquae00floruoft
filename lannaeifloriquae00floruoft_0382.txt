INTRODUCTION

the Abbey of Parc, was discovered and collated by
Roth. It belonged to the fifteenth century, but
represented an older tradition than the earlier
Sangallensis and Guelferbytanus. It found its way to
the library of Louvain, where it disappeared during
the late war. The collation of Roth is preserved in
the public library of Basle. Of about the same age
and value, so far as it goes, is a manuscript variously
known as the codem Danielinus or Gg‘fanz'anus (Dan.
or Gis), which was formerly at St. Benoit sur Loire,
but has been lost sight of since the sixteenth century.
Many of its readings have been more or less imper-
fectly preserved in the margin of the edition of
Langueil (1543). In many cases they are so similar
to those of the coclea: Gueffoebytanus Gudianus, 166,
(A) of the twelfth or thirteenth century, that Chate-
lain 1 thought it possible that codex A was actually
the famous Danielinus. Other manuscripts of value
are the Sangallensz's (Β), of the fourteenth century,
the MonacensiS, 88, (M), written at Ulm in 1482, and
3 manuscript of the Collegium Romanum (R). The
Utrecht edition of 1542 (u) represents 3 special
tradition and was ranked among the manuscripts by
Roth and Halm.

For other manuscripts added by Gemss, Winsted
and Guillemin, which occasionally furnish good
readings, see the list of sigla. All the existing
codices have the same lacuna at vi.2.3 and a number
of obvious errors in common, and hence are descended
from the same archetype, assumed to be 3 minuscule
manuscript not earlier than the eleventh century.

They are classified as follows by Guillemin ε (l) Dan.-
Gis„ P, A, θ, π; (2) Β, μς (3) u; (4) R. Μ, F, λ.
