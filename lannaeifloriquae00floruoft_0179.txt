also that the crimes may not obscure the virtues, shall
be related separately. And so, in the first place, in
accordance with our original plan, we will describe
the just and honourable wars waged against foreign
nations, in order that the greatness of the daily
increasing empire may be made manifest3 and after-
wards we will turn to the crimes and to the dis-

graceful and impious struggles of the citizens amongst
themselves.

XXXV. THE ASIA‘r1c WAR

20. W'HEN Spain had been conquered in the West,
the Roman people had peace in the East ; and they
not only had peace, but, by an unparalleled and un-
heard-of dispensation of fortune, wealth was left to
them by royal bequests and whole kingdoms at a
time passed into their hands. Attalus, king of Per-
gamon, son of King Eumenes, who had been our
former ally and supporter in war, left a will which
said, “ Let the Roman people be heir to my estate:
the following possessions now constitute the royal
property.’' 1 Entering, therefore, into this inheri-
tance, the Roman people took possession of a pro-
vince not by war or force of arms but, what is more
equitable, by the right conferred by a will. It is
difficult to say whether the Roman people lost
or recovered this province with greater ease.
Aristonicus, a high-spirited young man of the royal
blood, easily won over some of the cities which had
been accustomed to obey the kings, and compelled
3 few others—Myndos, Samos and Colophon—which
refused to join him. He also defeated the army
of the praetor Crassus and captured its commander.
