X. DION, 1x. 5-x. 3

the hatred of absolute power and the wretched
life of⁵ those who prefer to be feared rather than
loved was readily apparent to all; for Dion’s own
guards,1 if they had been well disposed, might have
broken open the door and saved him, since he was
still alive in the hands of his assailants, who were
unarmed and calling for a weapon from without.
But when no one came to his help, one Lyco, a
Syracusan, passed a sword through the windows,2
and with it the tyrant was slain.

10. After the murder had been committed and a
crowd had flocked in to see the sight, several men
were killed by mistake, in the belief that they had
done the deed. For the rumour that violence had
been offered to Dion quickly spread, and many
hastened to the spot to whom such a crime was
abhorrent. These it was who, misled by suspicion,
slew the innocent in place of the guilty. No sooner
was Dion’ s death made known than the sentiment of
the people changed in a remarkable manner. For
those who had called him a tyrant while he was
alive now insisted that he had saved his country and
freed it from a tyrant. Hence, on a sudden, pity
succeeded to hatred, and the people would have
redeemed him from Acheron, had it been possible, at
the price of their own blood. And so he was buried
in the most frequented part of the city at public
expense, and the place of his burial was marked by a
monument. He died at the age of about fifty-five, 353 Bc.
three years after returning from the Peloponnesus
to Sicily.

² Since Dion was in an upper room, the sword must have
been passed from the window of an adjacent house; hence

fenestras, instead of fenestram. It is true that the account of
Plutarch (Dion 57) differs from that of Nepos.
