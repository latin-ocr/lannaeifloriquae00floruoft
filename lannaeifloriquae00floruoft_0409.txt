ΙΙ. THEMISTOCLES, 1. 1-4

humble as not to be admitted to his presence. He
had great influence with all the Greek states, a
famous name, and great renown as a soldier. Having
in mind these advantages of his, the people preferred
that he should suffer, though innocent, rather than
that they should continue to be in fear.

II. THEMISTOCLES

1. Themistocles, son of Neocles, the Athenian.
This man’s faults in early youth gave place to such
great merits that no one is ranked above him and
few are thought to be his equals. But we must
begin our account of his life at the beginning. His
father Neocles was of high birth. He marrizd an
Acarnanian woman possessing the rights of citizen-
ship, who became the mother of Themistocles. The
son displeased his parents by living too lawlessly
and neglecting his property, and in consequence
was disinherited by his father. But this affront,
instead of breaking his spirit, aroused his ambition.
For believing that such a disgrace could be wiped
out only by the greatest industry, he devoted all
his time to public life, doing his best to gain friends
and distinction. He took a prominent part in civil
suits, and often came forward to speak in the public
assembly3 no business of importance was transacted
without him3 he was quick to see what was needed
and able to express his views clearly. Furthermore,
he was no less active in carrying out his plans than
he had been in devising them, because, as Thucy-
dides expresses it, he judged present events with
great exactness and divined the future with remark-
able skill. As a result he soon became famous.
