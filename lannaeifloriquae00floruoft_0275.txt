BOOK ΙΙ. v1111.

expects in war. But he ordered 4,000 unarmed
citizens who had been surrendered to be slain in the
Villa Publica.1 Do not all these 4,000 slain in peace
really outnumber those other 70‚OOO? who can
compute the total of those whom anyone, who wished
to do so, slew in various parts of the city? At last,
when Fufidius advised that some men ought to be
allowed to live in order that Sulla might have some-
one to whom to give orders, that vast proscription-
list was put up, and from the flower of the equestrian
order and the senate 2,ΟΟΟ men were chosen and
condemned to death. It was an edict for which
there was no precedent. It would be tedious after
this to relate the insulting end of Carbo and
Soranus, the deaths of Plaetorii and Venuleii ; how
Baebius was torn to pieces, not by the sword, but by
men's hands, like a wild beast3 and how Marius,
the brother of the general, after his eyes had been
gouged out at the tomb of Catulus, was kept alive
for some time after his hands and legs had been
broken off, so that he might die limb by limb. One
could endure the punishment of individuals, but the
most renowned towns of Italy were put up to
auction—Spoletium, Interamnium, Praeneste, Flo-
rentia. As for Sulmo, an allied and friendly city
of long standing, Sulla, instead of storming or
besieging it according to the rules of warfare, com-
mitted an act of base injustice in condemning the
city and ordering its destruction, even as those who
are condemned to death are ordered to be led to
execution.
