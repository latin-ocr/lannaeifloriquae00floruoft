victorious, having spread far and wide the terror
of his name and having slain or holding as prisoners
a large number of the enemy ’5 troops and even
of their generals, and having sent in advance to
Rome a fleet laden with immense spoils and full
of material for a triumph, was already threatening
Carthage itself, the author of the w ar, with blockade
and pressing hard upon its very gates. At this point
the breeze of fortune veeied somewhat, but only
in order to provide more evidence of the Roman
valour‚ the greatness of which is more often put
to the proof by misfortunes. For when the enemy
had resorted to foreign aid and Lacedaemon had
sent Xanthippus to be their general, we were
defeated by 3 very skilful leader——a disgraceful
disaster such as the Romans had never before
experieneed—and the brave commander-in-chief fell
alive into the enemies’ hands. But he proved
himself able to face such a calamity3 his spirit was
not broken either by a Carthaginian prison or by
the mission to Rome which he undertook. For,
contrary to the instructions of the enemy, he ex-
pressed an opinion against making peace or consent·
ing to an exchange of prisoners. His voluntary
return to his enemies and his final sufferings,
whether in prison or on the cross, in no way
sullied his dignity3 nay, rendered by all this only
the more worthy of admiration, what did he do
but triumph victorious over his victors and, since
Carthage had not yielded, over Fortune herself?
The Roman people, on their part, were even more
eager and intent on avenging Regulus than on
obtaining 3 victory.
