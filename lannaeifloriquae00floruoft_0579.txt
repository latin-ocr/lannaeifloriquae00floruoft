XVII. AGESILAUS

1. Agesilaus the Lacedaemonian was praised, not
only by all other historians, but in particular by
Xenophon, the disciple of Socrates, whose intimate
friend he was.

He began by having a dispute about the throne
with Leotychides, his brother's son; for it was the
custom of the Lacedaemonians, handed down from
their forefathers, always to have two kings (whose
power, however, was rather nominal than real) from
the families of Procles and Eurysthenes, who were
descendants of Hercules and the first kings at Sparta.
It was not lawful for one of these to be made king from
one family in place of the other 3 so each family kept
its order of succession. Consideration was first given
to the eldest of the children of the one who had died
upon the throne ; but if he had left no male offspring,
then his nearest relative was chosen. Now King Agis,
the brother ongesilaus,had died, leaving a son Leoty- 399 Β.ο.
chides3 he had not acknowledged the boy at his
birth, but on his death-bed he declared that he was
his son. He it was that disputed the title of king with
his uncle Agesilaus, but he was unsuccessfu13 for
thanks to the support of Lysander, a man, as we have
already shown, who at that time was ambitious and
powerful, Agesilaus was preferred.

2. As soon as Agesilaus was in possession of the
throne, he persuaded the Lacedaemonians to send
out armies to Asia and make war upon the king, 396 ac.
pointing out that it would be better to fight in Asia
than in Europe; for the rumour had gone forth that
Artaxerxes 1 was equipping a fleet and land forces
to send to Greece. As soon as permission was given
