and crowned like a king, he collected an army quite
as large as that of his fanatica] predecessor, and with
even greater energy, on the pretext of avenging
him, plundering villages, towns and fortresses, vented
his fury with even greater violence upon the slaves
than upon their masters, treating them as renegades.
He too routed praetorian armies and captured the
camps of Servilius and Lucullus. But Titus 1 Aquilius
following the example of Perperna, reduced the
enemy to extremities by cutting off their supplies
and easily destroyed their forces in battle when they
were reduced by starvation. They would have
surrendered, had they not, in their fear of punish-
ment, preferred voluntary death. The penalty could
not be inflicted upon their leader, although he fell
alive into their hands3 for, while the crowd was
quarrelling about his apprehension, the prey was
torn to pieces in the hands of the disputantS.

VIII. THE WAR AGAINST SPARTACUS

20. ΟΝΕ can tolerate, indeed, even the disgrace of
a war against slaves; for although, by force of

inferior class) of human beings and can be admitted ²
to the blessings of liberty which we enjoy. But I
know not what name to give to the war which was
stirred up at the instigation of Spartacus3 for the
common soldiers being slaves and their leaders being
gladiators—the former men of the huinblest, the
latter men of the worse, class—added insult to the
injury which they inflicted upon Rome.
