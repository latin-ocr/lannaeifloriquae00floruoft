BOOK Ι. xv111.-xv1111.

say that all Carthage was on board it. And it was
this that caused its ruin ; for the Roman fleet, easily
handled‚ light and unencumbered and in a way
resembling a land army, was guided by its oars just
as horses are guided by their reins in a cavalry
engagement, and the beaks of the ships, moving
rapidly to ram now this foe and now that, presented
the appearance of living creatureS. And so in a
moment of time the enemy’s vessels were cut to
pieces and covered the whole sea between Sicily
and Sardinia with their wreckage. In a word, so
great was the victory that no question was raised
of demolishing the enemy's walls; it seemed super-
fluous to vent their fury on a citadel and walls when
Carthage had already been destroyed upon the sea.

XVIIII. Tm: LIGURIAN WAR

3. Tm: Carthaginian war being ended, a period
of rest ensued, brief, indeed, for the Roman people
to recover their breath. As a proof of peace and
a genuine cessation of hostilities, the door of the
Temple of J anus was closed for the first time since the
reign of Numa3 but immediately afterwards it was
quickly opened again. For first the Ligurians and
then the Insubrian Gauls, and also the lllyrians,
races living at the foot of the Alps, that is, at the
very entrance of Italy, began to give trouble at the
continual instigation of some god, who feared that
Rome's arms should suffer from rust and decay. In
a word, both these races, continually active and, as
it were, at our very doors, provided our recruits with
practice in warfare, and the Roman people sharpened
the edge of their valour on these two people as on
the whetstone.
