name of Cornelius NepOS, are so great as to leave no
doubt that they are the work of the same writer.
Aemilius Probus, following in the footsteps of his
grandfather and his father, was apparently the editor

which the brief extract On Kings and the lives of
Datames, Hamilcar and Hannibal seem to have been

to the biography of Atticus. Thus the first edition
contained only Greeks and Romans.

although in this method of gratifying Roman national
