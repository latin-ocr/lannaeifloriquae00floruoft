daemonians and had two colleagues, one of whom was
Pelopidas, a man of courage and energy.

All these generals had become, through the charges
of their opponents, objects of suspicion, and for
that reason their command had been taken from
them and other leaders had been appointed in their
place. Epaminondas refused to obey the people's
decree, persuaded his colleagues to follow his example,
and continued the war which he had begun3 for he
knew that unless he did so, the entire army would be
lost, owing to the incapacity of the generals and their
ignorance of warfare. There was a law at Thebes
which punished with death anyone who had retained
a command beyond the time provided by that law.
Since Epaminondas realized that the law in question
had been passed for the safety of his country, he did
not wish it to contribute to the ruin of the state3
consequently, he retained his command for four
months longer than the time fixed by the people.

brought to trial for their disobedience. Epa-
minondas allowed them to throw the entire responsi-
bility upon him and to urge in their defence that it
was due to him that they had disobeyed the law.
That plea freed them from danger, and no one thought
that Epaminondas would put in an appearance, since
he had nothing to say in his defence. But he came
into court, denied none of the charges of his
opponentS, admitted everything that his colleagues
had said, and did not refuse to submit to the penalty
named in the law. He made only one request of the
judges, namely, that they should enter the following
record of his sentence.1
