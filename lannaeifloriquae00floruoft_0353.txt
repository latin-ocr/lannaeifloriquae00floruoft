XXVI. Tm: MonsmN WAR

IT is a repulsive task to describe the savagery and
cruelty of the Moesians and their barbarity sur-
passing that of all other barbarians. One of their
leaders, after calling for silence, exclaimed in front
of the host, “ Who are you? '’ And when the reply
was given, “We are Romans, lords of the world,’'
“So you will be,'' was the answer, “ if you conquer
us.’' Marcus Crassus accepted the omen. The
Moesians immediately sacrificed a horse in front of
the army and made a vow that they would offer up
and seed upon the vit-als of the slaughtered leaders
of their enemies. l can well believe that the gods
heard their boast, for they would not even endure the
sound of our trumpets. No little terror was inspired
in the barbarians by the centurion Cornidius, a man
of rather barbarous stupidity, which, however, was
not without effect upon men of similar character;
carrying on the top of his helmet a pan of coals
which were fanned by the movement of his body,
he scattered flame from his head, which had the
appearance of being on fire.

XXVII. THE THRACIAN WAR

Tnouon the Thracians had often revolted before,
their most serious rising had taken place now under
King Rhoemetalcis. He had accustomed the bar-
barians to the use of military standards and dis-
cipline and even of Roman weapons. Thoroughly
subdued by Piso, they showed their mad rage even
in captivity3 for they punished their own savagery
by trying to bite through their fetters.
