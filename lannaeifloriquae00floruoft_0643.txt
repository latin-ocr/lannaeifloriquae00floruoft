XXII. HAMILCAR, 11. 4—111. 3

That general not only drove the enemy from the
walls of Carthage‚ although they now numbered
more than a hundred thousand armed men, but
even succeeded in shutting them up in a narrow
defile, where more of them died of hunger than by
the sword. All the disaffected tovms, among which
were Utica and Hippo, the strongest places in all
Africa, he restored to his country. And not content
with that, he even extended the Carthaginian
frontiers, and brought about such a state of peace
all over Africa as to make it seem that there had
been no war there for many years.

3. After finishing these tasks to his satisfaction,
confident in spirit and hating the Romans, with the
view of more readily finding a pretext for war, he
contrived to be sent to Spain in command of an
army, and with him he took his son Hannibal, then
nine years old. He was accompanied also by a dis-
tinguished and handsome young man, Hasdrubal by
name, whom some said that Hamilcar loved less
honourably than was proper3 for so great a man
could not escape being slandered. Because of that
charge the censor of morals1 forbade Hasdrubal
to be with Hamilcar; but the general gave the
young man his daughter in marriage, since according
to the code of the Carthaginians a father-in-law
could not be denied the society of his 5011-111-13111.2
Ι have spoken of Hasdrubal because, when Hamilcar
was killed, he commanded the army3 and accom—
plished great things, but he was the first by gifts of
money to undermine the old-time morals of the
Carthaginians3 it was after his death too that
Hannibal succeeded to the chief command by choice
of the army.
