XIII. TIMOTHEUS, 111. 1—5

Menestheus, son of Iphicrates and son-in-law of
Timotheus, was made general, and it was decided
that he should undertake that war. He was given
as advisers two men eminent for their experience and
wisdom, his father and his father-in-law, since they
had such high standing as to inspire strong hopes that
through them what had been lost might be recovered.
The three then sailed for Samos, and Chares, who
had been advised of their coming, went with his
forces to the same place, in order that nothing might
seem to have been done without his presence. As
they were drawing near to the island, it chanced that
a great storm arose, and the two old generals,
thinking it best to avoid it, anchored their fleet.
But Chares, adopting a bold course, did not heed
the advice of his elders, believing that he was the
master of fortune. He arrived at his destination‚
and sent word to Timotheus and Iphicrates to join
him.

Then, having suffered defeat and lost a number of
his ships, he returned to the place from which he had
set out and sent an official report to Athens, alleging
that he could easily have taken Samos if he had not
been left in the lurch by Timotheus and Iphicrates.
Τὴθ Athenians, being impulsive, distrustful and
therefore changeable, hostile and envious (moreover,
the men who were accused were powerful), summoned
them all back home.1 They were cited to appear in
court and accused of treason. Timotheus was found
guilty and his fine was fixed at one hundred talents.
Whereupon, driven by indignation at his country's
ingratitude, he withdrew to Chalcis.2

⁸ In 355 B.o.; he died the same year.
