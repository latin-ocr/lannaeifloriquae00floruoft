XVII. AGESILAUS, 111. 2—1v. 1

soldiers, and Agesilaus led his army back to Ephesus
for the winter3 there he established manufactories of
arms and prepared for war with great energy. And in
order that the arms might be made with greater care
and adorned more artistically, he offered rewards to
those who showed the greatest energy in their manu-
facture. He followed the same plan with regard to
various forms of exercise, giving handsome prizes to
those who excelled their fellows ; and in that way he
succeeded in having an army both finely equipped
and excellently trained.

When it appeared to him to be time to lead his 395 ac.
troops from their winter quarters, he saw that if he
openly announced in advance where he was going
to march, the enemy would not believe him and would
post their garrisons in other regions, feeling sure that
he would do something different from what he had said.
And in fact, when he announced that he would march
upon Sardis, Tissaphernes, as before, thought that it
was Caria that he ought to defend. And when he was
mistaken in that, and saw that he had been outwitted,
he was too late in going to the defence of his country-
men3 for when he arrived at the spot, Agesilaus had
already stormed many places and got possession of
a great amount of booty. Moreover, since the
Laconian perceived that the enemy were superior in
cavalry, he always avoided meeting them on level
ground, but joined battle in places where infantry was
more effective3 and so, whenever he engaged, he
routed far superior forces of his opponents, and
conducted his campaigns in Asia in such a manner
that in the judgment of all men he was regarded as
the victor.
