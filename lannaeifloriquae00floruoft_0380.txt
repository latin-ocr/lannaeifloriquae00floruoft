Nepos was not skilled in the art of composition,
and as a result his work presents a combination of
nearly all possible types of biography.3 Besides the
Peripatetic biographies we have brief summaries in
the Alexandrine-philological manner (Cimon, Conon,
Iphicrates, Chabrias and Timotheus), and eulogies ·'
(encomia or laudationes) either in an approximation 4
to the conventional form taught in the schools of
rhetoric and based on the virtues of the hero (Epa-
minondas), or with a superficial resemblance to the
Agesilaus of Xenophon and based upon the hero's
exploits (Agesilaus). The Atticus, which is also a
eulogy, is unique in being originally written of a
person who was still living, after his death, as has
been said, it was somewhat changed. It is in the
main of the type represented by Xenophon’s Agesi-
laus and the brief laudation of Germanicus in
Suetonius' Caligula.⁵

Nepos writes as a rule in the ‘⁴ plain '’ style.⁶ His
vocabulary is limited, and he expresses himself
ordinarily in short sentences. The results of rhe-
torical training are shown in his attempts to adorn
his narrative, especially, although not consistently,4
in more elevated passages, when he depicts the
virtues of his heroes ⁷ or puts speeches into their
mouths. He occasionally attempts long periods, but
