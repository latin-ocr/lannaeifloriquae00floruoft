XXV. A'ITICUS, v111. 3-1x. 1

Gaius Flavius, a friend of Brutus, appealed to
Atticus to consent to take the initiative in the enter-
prise. He, however, thinking that he ought to render
service to his friends, but not join parties, and having
consistently held aloof from such measures, replied
that if Brutus wished to make any use of his means, he
might do so to the limit of his resources, but that he
would neither confer with anyone on the subject nor
meet with anyone. Thus the unanimity of that clique
was broken by the disagreement of this one man.

Not long after that, Antony began to gain the
upper hand, to such a degree that Brutus and Cassius
ceased to perform the dut-ies 1 which had been
assigned them as a pretext2 by the consul, and in
utter despair went into exile.3 But Atticus did not
the more on that account flatter the power of Antony
or abandon the lost cause. In fact, the man who had
declined to join with the rest in contributing money
when the party was prosperous, after Brutus had
fallen from power and was leaving Italy sent him a
gift of a hundred thousand sesterces3 and again,
when Brutus was in Epirus,4 he sent orders from Rome
that three hundred thousand more be given to the
regicide.

⁹9. After that came the war at Mutina. In the
course of which if I were merely to say that he showed
foresight‚ I should give him less credit than I ought,
since it was more properly divination, if the term

from the city for more than ten days. To conceal the real
reason for their departure, Antony had given them the charge
mentioned in note 1.

³ That was their version os their action3 in reality, they took
possession of Syria and Macedonia, which had been assigned
them as provinces by Caesar, and prepared for war.

⁴ Atticus had a large estate in Epirus; see 14. 3.
