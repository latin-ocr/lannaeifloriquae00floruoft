BOOK 1. xxx1111.

discipline, a battle was fought, and the sight of the
Numantines in ssight, which no one had ev en expected
to see, was actually realized. They w ere willing to
surrender if conditions were imposed to which men
of spirit could submit. But since Scipio desired a
complete and unqualified victory, they were first
reduced to the necessity of rushing into the fray
resolved to die, after they had first gorged themselves
with, as it were, a funeral banquet of half-raw flesh
and caelia} a name which they give to a local drink
made from corn. Their intention was perceived by
the general, and so, ready though they uere to die,
no opportunity was given them of fighting. W hen
famine pressed hard upon them—for they were
surrounded by a trench and breastwoek and four
camps—they begged the general to allow them to
engage him, so that he might slay them like men,
and, when their request was refused, they deter-
mined to make a sortie. This resulted in a battle in
which very many of thern were slain and, as hunger
pressed them hard, they lived for a while on the
dead bodies.2 Finally, they made up their minds to
fiee, but this was prevented by their wives, who cut
the girths of their horses—a grievous wrong, but due
to their affection. Despairing, therefore, of escape
and in a revulsion of rage and fury, they, at last,
under the leadership of Rhoecogenes, made an end
of themselves, their families and their native city
with the sword, with poison and with a general con-
flagration. All glory to a brave city, a city blessed,
so it seems to me, even in its misfortunes3 for it
loyally helped its allies and with so small a force
withstood for so long a period a people which was
supported by the resources of the whole world.
