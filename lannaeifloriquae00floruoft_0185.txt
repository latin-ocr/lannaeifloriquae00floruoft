BOOK I. xxxvt.

to defend not so much the might as the honour
of the Roman Empire. With great skill he used
their own wiles against the enemy, who sought to
delude him now with entreaties and now with
threats, at one moment by pretended and at another
by actual flight. Not content with laying waste the
fields and villages, he attacked the principal cities
of Numidia. He was unsuccessful indeed in his
assault upon Zama, but plundered Thala, a storehouse
of arms and royal treasures. He then pursued the
king, stripped of his cities and now a fugitive from
his country and kingdom, through Mauretania and
Gaetulia. Finally, Marius with considerably in-
creased forces (for, acting as one would expect a
low-born man to act, he had forced the lowest class
of citizens to enlist), though he attacked the king
when he was already routed and wounded, did not,
however, defeat him any more easily than if his
strength had been fresh and unimpaired. Marius
not only captured, by a wonderful stroke of good
fortune, the city of Capsa founded by Hercules in
the middle of Africa, defended by waterless tracts,
snakes and sand, but he also penetrated, thanks to
a Ligurian soldier,1 to Molucha, a city built on a
rocky height, the approach to which was steep
and inaccessible. Presently he defeated not only
Jugurtha himself but also Bocchus, king of
Mauretania, who from ties of kinship was supporting
the Numidians, near the city of Cirta. Bocchus,
apprehensive about his own interests and afraid
of being involved in another's ruin, offered the
person of Jugurtha as the price of a treaty and
friendship. Thus the most treacherous of kings was
entrapped by the. treachery of his own father-in-law
