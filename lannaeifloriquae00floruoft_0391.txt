PRAEFATIO, 4—8

At Lacedaemon no woman without a husband, how-
ever distinguished she may be, refuses to go to a
dinner-party as a hired entertainer.l Almost every-
where in Greece it was deemed a high honour to
be proclaimed victor at Olympia; even to appear
on the stage and exhibit oneself to the people was
never regarded as shameful by those nations. With
us, however, all those acts are classed either as
disgraceful, or as low and unworthy of respectable
conduct.

On the other hand, many actions are seemly
according to our code which the Greeks look upon
as shameful. For instance, what Roman would
blush to take his wife to a dinner-party? W hat
matron does not frequent the front rooms 2 of her
dwelling and show herself in public? But it is very
different in Greece; for there a woman is not
admitted to a dinner-party, unless relatives only are
present, and she keeps to the more retired part
of the house called “the women's apartment,'' to
which no man has access who is not near of kin.

But further enlargement of this topic is impossible,
not only because of the extent of my proposed work,
but also by my haste to treat the subject that I
have chosen. I shall therefore come to the point
and shall write in this book of the lives of celebrated
commanders.
