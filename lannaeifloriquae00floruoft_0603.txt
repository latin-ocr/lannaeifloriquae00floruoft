XVIII. EUMENES, v. 3—v1. 2

strategy, Eumenes was surrounded by superior
numberS. Yet he made his escape with the loss
of many of his men, and took refuge in a fortified
place in Phrygia, called Nora.

Being besieged there and fearing that by remaining
in one place he might ruin the horses of his army,
because there was no room for exercising them,
Eumenes hit upon a elever device by which an animal
standing in one place might be warmed and exercised,
so that it would have a better appetite and not lose
its bodily activity. He drew up its head 1 with a
thong so high that it could not quite touch the ground
with its forefeet, and then forced it by blows of a whip
to bound and kick out behind, an exercise which
produced no less sweat than running on a race-
course. The result was that, to the surprise of all,
the animals were led out of the fortress after a siege
of several months in as good condition as if he had
kept them in pasture. During this blockade, as often
as he wished, he set fire to some part of the works and
fortifications of Antigonus and threw down others.
Furtherrnore, he remained in the same place as long
as the winter lasted, because he could not camp in
the open. When spring drew near, pretending a
surrender, he outwitted Antigonus’ officers while the
terms were under discussion, and made his escape
without the loss of a man.

Epirus) and to make herself ruler there. He advised
her above all things to make no move, but to wait until
Alexander's son 2 gained the throne3 but if she was
