BOOK 1. xxii.

Gracchus secui-ed Sardinia3 the savagery of the
inhabitants and the vastness of the Mad Mountains
-for such is their name—availed it nothing. Its
cities, including Caralis, the capital, were treated
with severity, that a race which was obstinate and
contemptuous of life might at any rate be tamed by
the loss of the soil which it cultivated.

The two Scipios, Gnaeus and Publius, were sent
into Spain and had wrested practically the whole
of the country from the Carthaginians3 but, sur-
prised by the wiles of Carthaginian craft, they had
lost it again, although they had defeated their forces
in important battleS. But the stratagems of the
Carthaginians had overwhelmed one of them by
attacking him as he was measuring out a camp, and
the other by surrounding him with flames in a tower
to which he had with difficulty escaped. And so a
third Scipio, for whom the fate had already destined
a great name to be won in Africa, was sent with an
army to avenge his father and uncle, and recovered
the whole of Spain (an almost incredible feat) from
the Pyrenees to the Pillars of Hercules, that land
of warriors, so famous for its heroes and its warlike
exploits, that nursery of the enemy’s forces which
had taught the youthful Hannibal the art of war.
It is difficult to say which was greater, his speed or
his good fortune. To his speed, the four years of
his operations bear witness3 the ease of his conquest
is proved by the example of a single city, which was
captured on the very day on which the siege began,
while it was an omen of future victory in Africa that
the Spanish Carthage was so easily subdued. It is
certain, however, that the remarkable austerity
of the general contributed greatly to the subjugation
