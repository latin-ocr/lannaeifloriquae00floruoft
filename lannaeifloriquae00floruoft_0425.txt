II. THEMISTOCLES, v111. 7—1x. 4

would save his life. The sailor‚ filled with pity for
so distinguished a man, for a day and a night kept
his ship at anchor out at sea far off from the island,
and would not allow anyone to leave her. Then he
went on to Ephesus and there landed Themistocles,
who afterwards requited him for his services

9. I am aw are that many have written that
Tbemistocles passed over into Asia during the reign
of Xerxes, but I prefer to believe Thuc) dides,
because among the writers who have left a history
of those times he was most nearly contemporary
with Themistocles, besides being a native of the
same city. Now he says 1 that it was to Artaxerxes 2
that Themistocles came, and that he sent a letter to
the king in the following words: “ I, Themistocles,
have come to you, the man of all the Greeks who
brought the most ills upon your house, so long as
it was necessary for me to war against your father
and defend my native land. But I also did him
many more sav ours, so soon as I began to find my self
in safety and he was in danger. For when he
wished to return to Asia after having fought the
battle at Salamis, I informed him by letter of the
enemy’s plot to destroy the bridge which he had
made over the Hellespont and to cut off his retreat;
and it was that message which saved him from
danger. But now I have sought refuge with you
hounded as I am by all Greece, secking your friend-
ship;3 if I obtain it, you will have in me as good
a friend as I was a courageous foeman of Xerxes.
But with regard to the matters about which I wish
to confer with you, I ask you to allow me a year ’5
delay„ and let me come to you at the end of that
time.
