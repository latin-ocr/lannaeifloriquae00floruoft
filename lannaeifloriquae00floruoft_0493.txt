IX. CONON, Ν. 2-v. 2

able presents, Conon was sent to the seacoast‚ to
levy ships of war on the Cypriotes‚ Phoenicians and
other maritime states,1 and to fit out a fleet with
which in the following summer he could make the
sea safe3 Pharnabazus was appointed to help him,
as Conon himself had asked. &Vhen this was re-

parations with care, thinking that a more serious
war threatened them than if the contest was merely

But they were attacked by Conon off Cnidus and 394 ac.
put to flight in a great battle; many of their ships
were taken, several were sunk. That victory

Lacedaemonians. Conon m’th a part of his ships
went to his native city, saw to the rebuilding of the
walls both of the Piraeus and of Athens, which had 393 B.0.
been destroyed by Lysander, and gave to his fellow-
citizens the sum of fifty talents, which he had
received from Pharnabazus.

than in adversity. For after his decisive victory
over the fleet of the Peloponnesians, thinking that he
had avenged his country's wrongs, he entertained
ambitions beyond his powers. These, however,
were both patriotic and commendable, since he
desired to increase the strength of his native land at
