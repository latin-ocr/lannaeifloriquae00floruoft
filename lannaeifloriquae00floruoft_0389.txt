THE BOOK OF CORNELIUS NEPOS

ΟΝ THE

GREAT GENERALS OF FOREIGN NATIONS

PREFACE

I DoUB'r not, Atticus, that many readers will look
upon this kind of writing as trivial and unworthy of
the parts played by great men, when they find that
I have told who taught Epaminondas music or see
it mentioned among ζ31115 titles to fame that he was
a graceful dancer and a skilled performer on the
flute.l But such critics will for the most part be
men unfamiliar with Greek letters, who will think no
conduct proper which does not conform to their
own habits. If these men can be made to under-
stand that not all peoples look upon the same acts
as honourable or base, but that they judge them all
in the light of the usage of their forefathers, they will
not be surprised that I, in giving an account of the
merits of Greeks, have borne in mind the usage of
that nation. For example, it was no disgrace to
Cimon, an eminent citizen of Athens, to have his
own sister to wife,2 inasmuch as his countrymen
followed that same custom3 but according to our
standards such a union is considered impious. In
Crete it is thought praiseworthy for young men to
have had the greatest possible number of love affairs.
