XIII. TIMOTHEUS, ιν. 1—5

4. After his death the people repented of the
sentence they had passed upon Timotheus, remitted
nine- -tenths of the fine, and required his son Conon
to pay, for repaiiing a part of the city wall, only ten
talents. In this event we see the inconsistency of
Fortune3 for the very walls which his grandfather
had restored to his country from booty taken from
the enemy the younger Conon was compelled to
repair from his own estate with great dishonour to
his family. Now Timotheus lived a well-regulated
and wise life; although I might give many proofs of
this, I shall content myself with one, from which it
may easily be imagined how dear he was to his
friends. When he was a young man 1 and was
involved in a law—suit at Athens, not only did his
friends at home and those abroad 2 in private station
flock to his defence, but among the latter was none
other than J ason, tyrant of Thessaly, at that time the
most powerful of all such rulers. That great man,
although he did not think himself safe even in his
own country without guards, came to Athens without
a single attendant, being so devoted to his guest·
friend that he preferred to risk his own life rather
than fail Timotheus when he was defendjng his
honour. Yet Timotheus afterwards, by order of
the people, made war upon this very J ason, regard-
ing the rights of his country as more sacred than
those of hospitality.

ΤΙιε era of Athenian generals came to an end with
Iphicrates, Chabrias and Timotheus, and after the
death of those eminent men no general in that city
was worthy of notice.

I now pass to the bravest and ablest man of all the
barbarians, with the exception of thc two Car-
