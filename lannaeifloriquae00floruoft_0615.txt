XVIII. EUMENES, XI. 4—xr1. 4

fall into the hands of your enemy? ” To which
Eumenes answered: ‘⁴ Would that what you say
had happened; but the reason that it did not is
because I have never encountered a foeman stronger
than myself 3 for I have never joined battle with
anyone that he did not yield to me.'’ And that was
true, since it was not the enemy’s valour, but a
friend’s treachery, that undid him 1 . . . for he
had an imposing appearance, powers of endurance
that enabled him to bear hardship, and a graceful
figure rather than great size of body.

12. Since Antigonus did not dare to decide the
fate of his enemy on his own responsibility, he referred
the matter to a council. In that assembly all were
at first disturbed, wondering at the delay in executing
a man from whom they had suffered so much during
so many years, that they had often been reduced to
despair, and who had slain their greatest generals;
in short, the only man who, so long as he lived, could
threaten their peace of mind, and whose death would
relieve them from all trouble. Finally, they asked,
if Antigonus spared him, on what friends could he rely ?
For, they said, they would not remain in his service in
company with Eumenes. Antigonus, after learning
the decision of the council, nevertheless allowed him-
self a period of six days for reflection. But then,
beginning to fear the outbreak ofa revolt in the army,
he forbade anyone to have access to the prisoner, and
gave orders that he should be deprived of his daily
food3 for he declared that he would not do violence
to a man who had once been his friend. However,
Eumenes had not suffered hunger for more than two
days when, as they were moving camp,he was strangled

by his guards without the knowledge of Antigonus.
