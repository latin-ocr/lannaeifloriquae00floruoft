around the Peloponnesus and pillaged the land of
the Laconians, put their fleet to flight, and brought
Corcyra under the sway of Athens 3 he also joined to
Athens as allies the Epirotes, Athamanes, Chaones,
and all the peoples bordering on that part of the sea.
Thereupon the Lacedaemonians gave up a long-
continued contest, and voluntarily yielded to the 374 ac.
Athenians the first place in maritime power, making
peace on terms which acknowledged the supremacy
of Athens on the sea. That victory filled the people
of Attica with such great joy that then for the first
time an altar was publicly consecrated to Peace and
a feast established 1n her honour. 1 In order to per-
petuate the memory of so glorious a deed, the
Athenians set up a statue of Timotheus 1n the agora,
at the cost of the state. This was an honour which
had fallen to him alone of all men up to that time,
namely, that when the state had erected a statue to a
father, a son received the same tribute.2 Thus the
new statue of the son, placed beside that of the father,
revived the memory of the latter, which had now

own old.

had ceased to hold office, war began to threaten the
Athenians from every quarter: Samos had revolted,
the Hellespont had seceded,3 Philip of Macedon, who
was even then powerful, was making many plots.
Against the last-named Chares 4 had been sent, but
was not thought capable of defendjng the country.
