been acquitted. This benefactor Phocion not only
did not defend in time of danger, but he even
betrayed him.

But his downfall was due particularly to one 31:120
offence, committed when he held the highest office
in the gift of the people.1 On that occasion, being
warned by Dercylus that Nicanor, one of Cassander's
prefects, was plotting an attack on the Piraeus of
the Athenians, and being urged to take heed that
the state should not be deprived of supplies, Phocion
replied in the hearing of the people that there was
no danger and promised to assume all responsibility.
Not long afterwards Nicanor got possession of the
Piraeus, without which Athens cannot2 exist at
all; and when the people united to recover it by
force, Phocion not only issued no call to arms, but
refused to take command of the people when they
had armed themselves.

one of which favoured the populace, the other the
aristocrats. To the latter belonged Phocion and
Demetrius of Phalerum. Both these parties depended
upon the pati-onage of the Macedonians; for the
popular party sided with Polyperchon, the aristocrats
with Cassander. While these events were going·
on, Cassander was driven from Macedonia by Poly-
perchon. When that happened, the people, having
gained the upper hand, at once outlawed the
leaders of the opposing party and drove them from
Athens,3 including Phocion and Demetrius of
Phalerum3 then with reference to that action they

³ Some were banished3 others were condemned ῖο death
and fied from the city.
