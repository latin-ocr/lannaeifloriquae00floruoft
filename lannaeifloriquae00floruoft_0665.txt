XXIII. HANNIBAL, XI. 6-x11. 4

Thus Hannibal overcame the arms of Pergamum by
strategy3 and that was not the only instance of the
kind, but on many other occasions in land battles
he defeated his antagonists by a similar bit of
cleverness.

that in Rome envoys of Prusias were dining with
Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the ex-consul, and that 183 ac.
mention being made of Hannibal, one of the envoys
said that he was in the kingdom of Prusias. On the
following day Flamininus informed the senate. The
Fathers, believing that while Hannibal lived they
would never be free from plots. sent envoys to
Bithynia, among them Flamininus, to request the
king not to keep their bitterest foe at his court, but
to surrender him to the Romans. Prusias did not
dare to refuseÍ¾ he did, however, stipulate that they
would not ask him to do anything which was in
violation of the laws of hospitality. They them-
selves, if they could, might take him3 they would
easily find his place of abode. As a matter of fact,
Hannibal kept himself in one place, in a stronghold
which the king had given him, and he had so arranged
it that he had exits in every part of the building,
evidently being 1n fear of experiencing what actually
happened.

wlben the env oys of the Romans had come to the
place and surrounded his house with a great body of
troops, a slave looking out from one of the doors
reported that an unusual number of armed men were
in sight. Hannibal ordered him to go about to all
the doors of the building and hasten to inform him
whether he was beset in the same way on every side.
