VII. ALCIBIADES, v. 2-7

such that he could not be deceived, especially when
he had made up his mind that he must be on his
guard. Accordingly, he took refuge with Tissa-
phernes, one of the prefects of king Darius.l Having
won the Persian’s intimate friendship, and percciving
that the power of Athens was waning after the
reverse in Sicily, while that of Lacedaemon was
growing, he first conferred through intermediaries
with Pisander, a general who had an army at Samos,
hinting at the possibility of his return to Athens3
for Pisander held the same political opinions as
Alcibiades, being no friend to popular government
but favouring the aristocrats. Meeting with no
encouragement from him, Alcibiades was first 411B.C.
received by the army through Thrasybulus, son of
Lycus, and made general at Samos3 later, with the
support of Theramenes, he was restored by vote of
the people and in his absence was given equal
powers with Thrasybulus and Theramenes.

During the command of these three men such a
change of fortune took place that the Lacedaemon-
ians, who shortly before were flushed with success,
now in terror sued for peace. In fact, they had lost 410 ac.
five battles on land and three on the sea, and the
latter had cost them two hundred triremes, which
were captured and came into the hands of the
enemy.> Alcibiades, acting with his colleagues, had
recovered Ionia, the Hellespont, and, besides, many
Greek cities situated on the coast of Asia; several
of these they had stormed, including Byzantium3
but of quite as many they had secured the alliance
by their good judgment in showing mercy to their
prisoners. So, ladened with booty, and having en-
riched the army, they returned to Athens in triumph. 408 nc.
