XXV. ATTICUS, xvn. 1—xvn1. 4

justly prided himself at the funeral of his mother,
whom he buried at the age of ninety‚ being himself
sixty-seven‚ that he had never had occasion to seek a
reconciliation with his mother, and had never
quarrelled with his sister, who was about his own age.
That is an indication either that no cause of com-
plaint ever arose among them, or else that he was so
indulgent towards them as to think it impious to get
angry with those whom it was his duty to love. And
this conduct was due, not only to Nature, although we
all obey her, but also to training3 for he had so
thoroughly mastered the precepts of the great
philosophers, that he made use of them in the conduct
of his life and not merely for display.

18. He was a great imitator of the customs of the
men of old and a lover of the early times, of which
he had such a thorough knowledge that he gave a full
account of them in the work in which he set down the
chronological order of the magistrates.1 For there
is no law, no treaty of peace, no war, no illustrious
deed of the Roman people‚ which is not mentioned in
that work at its proper date, and—a most difficult
task—he has so worked out the genealogies of the
families, that from it we can learn the descendants
of our famous men. He has treated this same subject
by itself in other books3 for example, at the request
of Marcus Brutus he gave an account of the J unii
in order, from their origin down to our omi time,
noting the parentage of each member of the family
and the offices which he had held, with their dates.
He did the same at the request of Claudius Marcellus
for the Marcelli, at that of Cornelius Scipio2 and

² Scipio AIricanus the younger, who was an Aemilius adopted
by a Scipio.
