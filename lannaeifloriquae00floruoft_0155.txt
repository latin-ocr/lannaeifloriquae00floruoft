BOOK Ι. xxx.

quered for a third time, both nations began hostilities
at the same time. The Macedonians were the first
to throw off the yoke, having grown far more formid-
able than before, because they were treated with con-
tempt. The cause of the war almost makes one
blush for shame, Andriscus, a man of the lowest
origin, had seized the throne and begun war at the
same moment. It is uncertain whether he was a
freeman or a slave, but he had certainly served as
a hired labourer; however, being popularly called
Philip from his resemblance to Philip, son of PerseS,
he supplied a royal presence, a royal name and a
royal spirit as well. The Roman people then,
despising all these pretensions and considering the
praeter J uventius as a match for him, rashly engaged
him when he was strongly supported not only by
the Macedonians but by vast numbers of Thracian
auxiliaries, and though they had never been beaten
by real kings, were defeated by this pretended and
stage-play monarch. However, ample vengeance
was taken by the consul Metellus1 for the loss of the
praetor and his legion. For he not only punished
the Macedonians by enslaving them, but also brought
back in chains to the city the instigator of the war,
who was surrendered to them by a Thracian prince
with whom he had taken refuge. Fortune, how-
ever, thus far smiled upon him in his misfortune
that the Roman people triumphed over him as
though he had been a real king.
