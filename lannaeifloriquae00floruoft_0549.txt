him a pledge to that effect in the Persian fashion with
his right hand. When he had received that pledge
from the king's messenger,1 Mithridates prepared
his forces and made friends with Datames without
meeting him. He then began to raid the king’s
provinces and storm his forti-esses, gaining a great
amount of booty, of which he divided a part among
his soldiers and sent a part to Datames3 he like-
wise handed over several fortresses to the Carian.
By continuing this conduct for a long time he
convinced Datames that he was engaged in im-
placable war against the king, while nevertheless,
to avoid exciting any suspicion of treachery,
he neither sought an interview with his intended
victim, nor did he try to meet him face to face.
From a distance he played the part of a friend, in
such a way that they seemed to be united, not by
mutual services, but by the common hatred which
they felt for the king.

his enmityto the king sufficiently evident,he informed
Datames that it was time to raise greater armies
and make war directly on Artaxerxes3 and he
invited him to hold a conference about that matter,
if he approved, in any place that he wished. The
proposition was accepted, and a time and place
appointed for their meeting. Mithridates went to
the spot several days in advance, with a single com·
panion in whom he had the greatest confidence 3 and
in several different places, which he carefully marked,
he buried swords. And on the very day of the
meeting both parties sent men to examine the place
and search the generals themselves; then the two
met.
