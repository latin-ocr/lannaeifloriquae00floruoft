commander, who, with her two children in her arms,
hurled herself from the roof of her house into the
midst of the flames, following the example of the
queen who founded Carthage!1 How mighty was
the city which was destroyed is shown, to mention

effort that the flames were with difficulty put out

houses and temples‚ in order that, since the city
could not be saved from the Romans, the material
for a triumph might be burnt.
