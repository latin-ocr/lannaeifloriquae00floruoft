BOOK I. xi„

Having pitched his camp at the very foot of the
Caucasus, he ordered their king, Orodes, to descend
into the plain, while he commanded Arthoces, who
was ruler of the lberians, to hand over his children
as hostages3 he even rewarded Orodes, who actually
sent a golden bed and other gifts from his kingdom
of Albania. Furthermore, turning his army south-
wards, he passed through the Lebanon in Syria and
through Damascus, and bore the Roman standards
through the famous scented groves and woods of
frankincense and balm. He found the Arabs ready
to carry out any orders which he might give. The
Jews attempted to defend J erusalem3 but this also
he entered and saw the great secret of that impious
nation laid open to view, the heavens beneath a

olden vine.1 Being appointed arbitrator between
t e two brothers who were disputing the throne,
he decided in favour of Hyrcanus and threw Aristo-
bolus into prison, because he was seeking to restore
his power. Thus the Roman people, under the
leadership of Pompeius, traversed the whole of Asia
in its widest extent and made what had been the
furthest province into a central province32 for with
the exception of the Parthians, who preferred to
make a treaty, and the Indians, who as yet knew
nothing of us, all Asia between the Red and Caspian
Seas and the Ocean was in our power, conquered or
overawed by the arms of Pompeius.
