XIX. PHOCION, 111. 2—1v. 4

sent envoys to Polyperchon, to beg him to confirm
their decrees. Phocion also went to Polyperchon.
On his arrival 116 was ordered to plead his cause,
ostensibly before King Philip‚1 but actually before
Polyperchon; for he then had the management of
the king’s affairs. Phocion was accused by Hagnon
of having betrayed the Piraeus to Nicanor, was
imprisoned by the decision of the council, and was
then taken to Athens, in order that he might there
be judged according to the laws of the Athenians.
4. When he arrived in the city, he was now unable
to proceed on foot because of his age, and was taken
to the court in a carriage. A great crowd collected,
some of whom remembered his past glory and pitied
his years, although the greater number were filled
with bitter anger because of their suspicion that he
had betrayed the Piraeus, and especially because
in his old age he had opposed the interests of the
people. In consequence, he was not even given
the opportunity of making a speech and of pleading
his cause. Then he was condemned by the
court, after certain legal forms had been observed,
and was turned over to the Eleven, who, according
to the custom of the Athenians, regularly have
official charge of the punishment of the condemned.²
As he was being led to execution, he was met by
Euphiletus, who had been his intimate friend.
WVhen the latter said with tears in his eyes: ‘⁴ Oh,
how unmerited is the treatment you are suffering,
Phocion! '' the prisoner replied: “But it is not
unexpected3 for nearly all the distinguished men
of Athens have met this end.’' Such was the hatred

² They had charge of executione„ which were actually
performed by an executioner.
