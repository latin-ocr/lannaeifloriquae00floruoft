XXII. HAMILCAR, 1. 3—11. 3

Though he burned with desire for war, yet Hamilcar
thought that he ought to strive for peace; for he
knew that his country was in financial sti-aits and
could no longer support the disasters of war. But
in so doing he at once began to plan to renew the
war, if only Carthage should recover a little strength,
and to bear arms against the Romans until his
countrymen won the victory by their valour or were
defeated and gave up the contest. It was with
that end in view that he conducted the negotiations,
in the coffrse of which he was so sels-confident that,
when Catulus declared that he would not cease
from war unless his opponent and all those who
defended Eryx would lay down their arms and leave
Sicily, he declared that his country should fall and
he himself perish before he would return home in
such disgrace3 for it was unworthy of his courage
to surrender to her foes the arms which he had
received from his country to use against her enemies.
And such was his obstinacy that Catulus yielded.

2. But when he came to Carthage, he learned
that the state was in a far different condition than
he had hoped 3 for by the long—continued ill-fortune
abroad so serious a civil war had been kindled that 240-238
Carthage was never in so great danger except when ΒΕ·
the city was destroyed. To begin with, the mer-
cenary soldiers whom they had used against the
Romans had revolted‚ to the number of twenty
thousand men. They roused all Africa to rebellion
and even attacked Carthage, By these troubles
the Carthaginians were so greatly alai-med that
they even asked help of the Romans, and obtained
it. But finally, being almost reduced to despair,
they made Hamilcar commander-in-chief. 232 13.e.
