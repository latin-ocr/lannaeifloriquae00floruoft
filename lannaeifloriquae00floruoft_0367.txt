BOOK II. xxxin.

, were carried out by Antistius and Furnius, his ¹
, lieutenant-generals, and Agrippa, while he was
, wintering on the coast at Tarraco. Himself arriving
’ quickly on the scene, he brought some of the
inhabitants down from the mountains, secured the
fidelity of others by taking hostages, and sold others,
by right of conquest, into slavery. His success was
considered by the senate to be worthy of a laurel
crown and a triumpha] chariot ; but Caesar was now so
mighty that he despised any glory that a triumph
could bestow. The Asturians meanwhile had come
down from the snow·clad mountains in a vast host.
This attack seems not to have been undertaken
without consideration by the barbarians3 but they
pitched their camp at the river Astura and, dividing
their forces into three parts, prepared a simultaneous
attack on the three camps of the Romans. With
such brave enemies attacking suddenly and with so
well—conceived a plan the struggle would have been
doubtful and bloody—and I would I could think
that the losses on both sides would have been equa] 1
—had not the Brigaecini acted as traitors and had
' not Carisius arrived with his army as a result of their
warnings. To have frustrated the enemy’s designs
meant victory, though, even so, the struggle was a
bloody one. The well-fortified city of Lancea
opened its gates to the remains of the defeated
army; here such efforts were needed to counteract
the natural advantage of the place, that when fire-
brands were demanded to burn the captured city, it
was only with difficulty that the general won mercy
for it from the soldiers, on the plea that it would
form a better monument of the Roman victory if it
were left standing than if it were burnt.
