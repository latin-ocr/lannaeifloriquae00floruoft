The Codeae V ratislaviensis Rehdigeranus R78
(ΗΘΜ.) of the fifteenth century but con-
taining some excellent corrections-

Another important authority for the text of
Florus is the work of the historian Jordanes (1), a
Goth, who in the middle of the sixth century
wrote a work entitled De summa temporum vel origine
actibusque gentis Romanorum, in which he made ex-
tensive use of Florus3 he copies him, with a few
omissions and alterations, for the period down to the
Macedonian wars (Florus, I, 1-28), and again for
the Parthian war (Ι, 46), the war against Antony
and Cleopatra (Il, 21), and the wars of Augustus
(ΙΙ, 22-27). Although the MS. of Florus which
Jordanes used was much older than B, it was closely
allied to it and has many faults in common with it,
and only occasionally provides a better reading.
Jordanes is a somewhat uncertain guide: he him-
self confesses that he was agrammaticus, and he
sometimes misunderstands his authorities3 but where
he confirms the reading of B, as he often does, his
testimony is of great value. His work has been
preserved in several MSS„ of which the Codex
Heidelbergensis and the Codex Pollingensis are the
most important.

For the text of the present edition B is taken as
the basis, and the apparatus criticus aims at giving the
authority, whether of an MS. or of an editor, for
any important variations from the readings of Β
which have been inserted in the text. In order
not to overburden the apparatus criticus, where the
reading of B has been adopted, none of the variants
which may be presented by the other MSS. are
