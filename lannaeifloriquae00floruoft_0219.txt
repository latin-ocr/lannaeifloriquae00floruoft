easy prey, they actually dared to assail it, and at the
first onslaught covered it with a shower of stones
and rocks. They fight with three slings apiece;
and who can wonder that their aim is so accurate,
seeing that this is their only kind of arm and its
employment their sole pursuit from infancy? A

alarm caused among the Romans by their slinging
of stones did not last long3 when it came to close

Cyprus too was taken over without any fighting.
This island, rich in ancient wealth and therefore
dedicated to Venus, was under the rule of Ptolemy.
But such was the fame of its riches (and not without

allied to themselves and still living, should be con-

anticipated fate by taking poison, and Porcius Cato
brought the wealth of Cyprus in Liburnian galleys
to the mouth of the Tiber. This replenished the
treasury of the Roman people more effectively than
any triumph.
