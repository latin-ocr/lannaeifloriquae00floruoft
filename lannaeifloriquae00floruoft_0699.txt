XXV. ATTICUS, xm. 2—X1v. 1

But he made no changes in it, except such as lapse of
time compelled. He had slaves that were excellent
in point of efficiency‚ although in personal appearance
hardly mediocre ; for there were among them servants
who were highly educated, some excellent readers
and a great number of copyists3 in fact, there was
not even a footman who was not expert in both those
accomplishments. In the same way, the other artisans
required by the management of a house were of first-
rate quality. In spite of this, however, he possessed
no slave who was not born in his house and trained at
home, which is a sign, not only of his self-control,
but also of his spirit of economy. For not to desire
immoderately what you see coveted by many ought
to be considered a mark of sels-control, and to acquire
property by labour rather than by money is a token
of no slight regard for economy. He was tasteful
rather than magnificent, distinguished rather than
extravagant3 and all his efforts were in the direction
of elegance, not of excess. His furniture was modest,
not abundant, so that it attracted attention in neither
direction.

I shall not pass over the fact, although I suppose
that some will regard it as trivial, that although he
was one of the richest of the Roman knights, and with
no little generosity invited to his house men of all
rankS, we know from the entries in his day-book that
he consistently limited his expenses to not more
than three thousand sesterces each month. And
this I state not from hearsay, but from actual know-
ledge3 for because of our intimacy I was often
familiar with the details of his domestic life.
