13. Thus it was that Eumenes at the age of forty· 310 n c.
five, having from his twentieth year served Philip,
as I said above, having held the same position with
Alexander for thirteen years, and having during
that time commanded a corps of cavalry for a year3
having been, after the death of Alexander the Great,
at the head of an army and either defeated or slain
the greatest generals, fell victim, not to the valour
of Antigonus, but to the false witness of the Mace-

high he stood in the estimation of all those who after
the death of Alexander the Great assumed the title
of king may most easily be judged from the fact
that while Eumenes lived no one was called king,
but only prefect. But after his death those same
men at once assumed the state and name of king,
and no one, as all had professed in the beginning,
attempted to maintain that he was keeping the
throne for the children of Alexander, but after
getting rid of their only champion, the rivals dis-
closed their real designs. The leaders in that crime
were Antigonus, Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus
and Cassander.

worthy of a soldier and an eminent man, which was
attended by all the army3 and they had his ashes
taken to his mother, wife and children in Cappadocia.
