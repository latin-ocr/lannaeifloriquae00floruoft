Since I think that I have said enough about these

XXII. HAMILCAR

1. Hamilcar the Carthaginian, son of Hannibal and
surnamed Barca, in the first Punic war, but when it
was nearly ended, was first put in command of an
army in Sicily, when he was a very young man.
Although before his arrival the Carthaginians
were faring badly by land and sea, wherever he was
present in person he never yielded to the enemy
or gave them a chance to do harm; on the contrary,
he often attacked them, when opportunity offered,
and invariably came off victor. Besides that, when
the Carthaginians had lost almost everything in Sicily,
he defended Eryx with such success that one might
have thought that there had been no war in that
quarter. In the meantime the Carthaginians, after
being defeated in a naval battle off the Aegates
islands by Gaius Lutatius,2 the Roman consul, deter-
mined to put an end to the war and gave Hamilcar
full powers to conduct the negotiations.
