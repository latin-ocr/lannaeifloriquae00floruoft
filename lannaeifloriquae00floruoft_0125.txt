him in battle3 they came to close quarters with
him, smote him in his beloved Campania, and forced
him to abandon the siege of Nola. They also
ventured, under the leadership of Sempronius
Gracchus, to pursue him through Lucania, and to
press hard upon his real-guard as he retired, though
on this occasion they fought him with an army of
slaves—a sad disgrace3 for their many misfortunes
had reduced them to this expedient. But these
men, presented with their liberty, made themselves,
by their valour, Romans instead of slaves. How
amazing was the confidence of the Roman people
amid so many adversities! How extraordinary
their courage and spirit! Though their fortunes
were so reduced and brought low that they might
well have had misgivings about their own land of
Italy, they yet ventured to turn their eyes in various
other directions3 and while the enemy, clinging to
their very throat, were rushing hither and thither
through Campania and Apulia and creating another
Africa in the very heart of Italy, they not only
withstood them but at the same time spread their
troops over the face of the earth, sending them
to Sicily, Sardinia and Spain.

Sicily was the area assigned to Marcellus; and
it did not long resist him; for the whole island was
subjugated by the defeat of a single city. Syracuse,
the mighty and hitherto unconquered capital,
though it was defended by the genius of Archimedes,
at length yielded. Of no avail were its triple walls,
its three citadels, its hai-bour of marble and the
celebrated Fountain of Arethusa, the only advan-
tage which they conferred was that the beauties
of the conquered city were spared.
