INTRODUCTION

was intimate with Atticus after the latter's return
from Athens in 65 B.c. Catullus dedicated a book
of poems to him in complimentary lines.1

A reference of Fronto 2 seems to indicate that
Nepos, like his friend Atticus, was a publisher, as
well as a writer, of books.

Nepos was a prolific author in several branches of
literature. The greater part of his works has been
lost and is known to us only through references of
other writers. The list is as follows:

Love Poems, mentioned by the younger Pliny in
the letter cited above.3

Chronica, referred to by Catullus in his dedication.
This work comprised in three books an outline
of the history of the world from the earliest
times to about 54 B.c. Like the Liber Annalis ‘²
of Atticus, it was of a chronological character.

Exempla, a collection of anecdotes arranged under
various captions, like the Factorum et Dictorum
Memorabilium libri IX of Valerius Maximus, and
intended for the use of rhetoricians. A fifth
book is cited by Gellius.5 It must have been
published after 43 B.C.⁶

A sze of Cato, mentioned by Nepos himself.⁷

A Life of Cicero,8 apparently composed after the
death of the orator.

A treatise on Geography, known, though not by
title, from references of the elder Pliny and
Pomponius Mela. The former speaks of it as
uncritical.⁹
