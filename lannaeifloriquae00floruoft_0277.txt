X. Tm: WAR wi‘rn SERTomus

22. WHAT was the war with Sertorius except an
inheritance from the Sullan proscription? Ι know
not whether to call it a war against enemies or a
civil war, for it was waged by the Lusitani and Celti-
beri under a Roman leader. Sertorius, an exile and
fugitive from that fatal proscription-list, a man of
great, but ill-starred, valour, involved seas and lands
in his personal misfortunes. Having tried his
fortune at one time in Africa, at another time in
the Balearic Islands, he extended his plans to include
the Ocean and Fortunate Isles, and finally armed
Spain. Abiaxe man easily unites with other brave
men3 and the energy of the Spanish soldiers never
appeared to better advantage than under a Roman
leader. Yet Spain was not enough for him, and he
turned his gaze towards Mithridates and the people
of Pontus and helped the king with his fleet. Why
should such a general have limited his ambitions,
when the Roman State could not withstand him with
one general only? Gnaeus Pompeius was therefore
sent to help Metellus. They wore down his forces,
pursuing him over almost the whole of Spain. The
fighting continued for a long time, always with
doubtful result3 and his defeat was due not so much
to operations in the field as to the crime and treachery
of his own followers. The first engagements were
fought by lieutenant-generals, Domitius and Thorius
commencing operations on one side and the Hirtulei
on the other. After the defeat of the latter at
Segovia and of the former at the River Ana, the
generals themselves tried their strength in combat
and suffered equal disasters at Lauro and Sucro.
